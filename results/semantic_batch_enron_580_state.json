Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.  Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items.

I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.\nCan I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.\nTiming is next few days.

They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tQuigley, Dutch  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 31, 2001 10:51 AM\nTo:\tWesner-Soong, Sarah\nSubject:\tRE: EDF Man\n\nSarah , \n\nWhat I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.\n\tPrior to moves                After\nDEC\t-2,003\t\t\t 1,967\nJAN\t10,502\t\t\t-1,588\nFEB\t 1,338\t\t\t   552\nMAR\t-7,013\t\t\t   188\nAPR\t 5,831\t\t\t     33\n\nthe over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.\n\nLet me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.\nWe can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.\n\nDutch\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tWesner-Soong, Sarah  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 31, 2001 10:41 AM\nTo:\tQuigley, Dutch\nSubject:\tEDF Man\n\nDutch - please send me the numbers.

After an initial rally on payroll figures\nthat were not as weak as feared, and a subsequent selloff later\nin the session on weaker-than-expected manufacturing data, the\nNASDAQ clawed its way back to its highs of the day. Indeed,\nbargain hunters continue to support the index by buying on the\ndips. The gains on the NASDAQ have also helped bring the Dow and\nS&P 500 off early lows. Sectors outperforming during today's\nsession included the semiconductors, computer software, drugs and\nhealthcare providers. Insurance providers, telephone and electric\npower companies were the worst-performing sectors.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nU.S. TREASURY SUMMARY\n\nTreasuries were broadly higher across the board in midday\ntrading. Initially, a stronger-than-expected payroll report\nweighed on the longer-dated issues, but poor manufacturing data\nhelped the bond turn the corner and rally sharply higher.\nSubsequent weakness in the stock market was also supportive for\nTreasuries, though the shorter-dated issues remained constrained\nby beliefs the Federal Reserve is nevertheless nearing the end of\nits current interest-rate easing cycle.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCURRENCY SUMMARY\n\nThe euro failed to breach the 0.850 level, with the common\ncurrency now likely to trade within a narrow range for the\nremainder of the session.

It was pushed on August 30, so \nif in a future order the Commission were to require refunds, they would be \ncalculated beginning October 29th. \n---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 10/05/2000 11:43 AM \n---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  \"Ronald Carroll\" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com>                           \n10/05/2000 07:51 AM\n\t\n\nTo: <mary.hain@enron.com>, <smara@enron.com>, \n<seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com>, <cfi1@tca-us.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Electric Power Plus Article re FERC Chairman Hoecker's Congressional \nTestimony\n\n\nLaw changes needed for retroactive refunds\n\nFERC'S Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority\n_______________________________________________\nDate: October 2, 2000 -\n\n\nFERC Chairman James Hoecker (D) told a congressional panel that the \ncommission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against \nmarket power in a competitive environment. Hoecker also urged the congressmen \nto give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility \nindustry's transition to competition.\n\nHoecker's plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California, where \nsome state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after \nprices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this \nsummer. Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will \nconsider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the state's bulk \npower markets, it is clear that currently, the commission does not have that \nauthority to do so retroactively.\n\n\"The [Federal Power Act] would have to be changed,\" a FERC staffer says.\n\nFor its own study -- which began in August -- Hoecker claimed that the \ncommission, if proven necessary, would consider ordering refunds if market \nparticipants were indeed price gouging. However, the Federal Power Act (FPA) \n-- the law that gives the commission much of its authority -- does not \nconsider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is \nprobably needed to see if the commission can do that.\n\n\"If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, \nwe will do so,\" Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept. \n21. \"If market power is being exercised, we will respond accordingly, by \nrevoking or modifying market-based rates or reassuring the basis upon which \nwe grant them. We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA, if \nrefunds are justified by record evidence. However, the FPA defines the \ncommission's authority, and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures \nwith California (and other states).\"\n\nCurrently, the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions \nmade 60 days after the commission initiates an investigation, which in this \ncase would be Oct. 13. However, the law makes no mention of retroactive \nratemaking, and FERC officials admit that to do so, the law needs to be \nchanged.\n\n\"Based upon what I know, the authority of the commission to issue refunds for \nany period before 60 days following our [investigation] order is highly \nproblematic,\" Commissioner William Massey (D) told Electric Power Alert. \n\"There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that, it would be \nunlawful and we would need legislation to do that.\"\n\nThe Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), held a \nmid-afternoon Sept. 21 hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a \nsevere energy crisis this winter. The committee heard testimony from Hoecker, \nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nAdministrator Carol Browner.\n\nMuch of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets, but both \nRichardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for \nfailing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year. Richardson \nexpressed his \"disappointment\" that nothing passed, while Hoecker claimed \nthat FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power.\n\n\"Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United \nStates under the same rules for non-discriminatory open access and comparable \nservice,\" Hoecker said. \"The commission's open access rules are not binding \non the part of the nation's transmission system . . . owned or controlled by \nentities other than public utilities. Open access over the facilities of \npublic power and other non-public utilities would promote greater competition \nin wholesale markets, by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers \nand sellers.\"\n\nHoecker pointed to FERC's investigation into bulk power markets and \nCalifornia's energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives \nclear legislative direction, FERC will extremely limited in what it could do \nto solve the market problems.\n\n\"Congress, too, has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to \nobtain the energy they need at reasonable prices,\" Hoecker said. \"Most \ncritically, events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting \nelectricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition. \nFederal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate \ninvestment in generation and transmission facilities, and higher levels of \nreliability which is crucial to the digital economy.\"\n\nThe chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate \nregional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability \nstandards. Currently, the House is considering a bill that would make the \ncommission a federal backstop for reliability, but most congressional sources \ndo not expect the bill to pass (see related story).\n\n\n\n\n\n_source: Electric Power Alert\n_date: October 2, 2000\n_issue: Vol. 10, No. 20\n_title: FERC's Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority\n, Inside Washington Publishers",

(PR); Shapiro, Richard; Curry, Wanda; Mellencamp, Lisa; Higgason, Kelly; Whalley, Greg; Mellencamp, Lisa\nSubject:\tCalifornia Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR\n\nIn what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.\nThe vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.\nDavis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.\n\nWhat is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?\nIt would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.\nIt would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.\n\nWhat are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?\nWith the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.\nThe political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.\nIt remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.\nUnder the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.\nIn short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.\nSafe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to \"solving\" California electricity crisis in shambles.\n\nWhat Next?\nA broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.\nThe bill would create a \"dedicated rate component\" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.\nProponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the \"dedicated rate component\" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.\nThe bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.\nAll four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.\nDavis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.\nGiven today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.\n\nUpdate on Edison Bailout\nStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another \"special\" session next Tuesday.\n\nIf you have any questions, just let us know.\n\nBest,\nJeff",

Although \nshe voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC \n\"should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action.\" \nBreathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action \nexpansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the \n\"extraordinary regulatory treatment\" that the Commission gave it. Critics \nclaim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler \nRidge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she \nnoted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. \n\"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in \nthe California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how \nour approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing \nelectric generation in California this summer,\" Breathitt said. If anything, \nshe noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even \nworse than it is. \nThere should have been a \"fuller airing of this issue\" at FERC before the \nproject was certificated, she noted. \"It would be counterproductive for this \nCommission to act precipitously on projects related to California without \nensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more \nimportantly, that they will cause no further harm.\" \nThe Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas \nand Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, \nthat claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing \ncustomers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over \nexpansion shippers. \n\"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative \nimpacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,\" the order said \n[CP01-106. For starters, \"the record does not show that pro-rata allocations \nof primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge.\" Kern River \nreports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at \nWheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result \nof this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the \nWheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 \nMMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave \nPipeline shippers, it noted. \n\"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be \ngreater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. \nThe Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes \nattributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to \nWheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide \nsufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,\" the order said. \n\"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at \nWheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing \nthe problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation \npath rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction.\" \nThe project would increase the \"limited-term, incremental transportation \ncapacity\" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help \naddress the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 \nhorsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor \nstations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and \nan existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has \na targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. \nKern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the \nproject, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced \nby permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending \nat FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of \nthe pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project \nrecently went through an open season",

He reports to Anna Walker, \nthe Director General of Energy at the DTI.  Ian also knows Paul, and I am \nsure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location.  Anyway, \nhere is what he asked:  They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, \nEdward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is \ngetting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his \nfiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there.  The UK DTI will keep \npaying him, so he is effectively free to us.  They want a relevant job/work \nexperience for him.  Ian does not know about his willingness to commute \nduring the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to \nthese kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check.  I think it \nwould be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for \nendearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant \nto the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that \nis something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK.  I would think \nchallenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo \nwriting, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the \npolicy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts?   I can \nget his CV when you need it.  thanks  mcs",

      "content": "Chicago Residents\u0001, Natural Gas Bills Could Rise 50 Percent \n                    Source: Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News \n                    Publication date: 2000-10-03\n\n\n                    Oct. 3--Chicago residents are likely to see their\n                    natural gas heating bills jump as much as 50\n                    percent this season, officials with Peoples\n                    Energy Corp. said Monday. \n\n                    Prices for natural gas are almost double what they\n                    were a year ago, pushed upward as the nation's\n                    booming economy makes demands on a tight\n                    supply. And many electric utilities are switching\n                    from coal-fired generation plants to natural gas\n                    generation plants, adding to pressure on the supply.\n\n                    Natural gas prices were about $1.85 per metric\n                    thousand cubic feet at the source last year. But\n                    through July of this year, the price was $3.49 per\n                    mcf--an 89 percent increase. \n\n                    Those prices may translate to sticker shock when\n                    Chicago-area consumers open their bills this winter.\n\n                    For October 1999 through March 2000, the average\n                    Peoples Energy residential customer who uses\n                    natural gas for home heating and cooking paid\n                    $735. This season, Peoples Energy is projecting\n                    that same customer will pay $1,083, said Luis\n                    Diaz-Perez, a Peoples spokesman. \n\n                    \"We are going to continue to communicate with our\n                    customers on ways to manage this winter's bill,\n                    whether that be through tips on economizing at\n                    home or information about payment plans and\n                    financial assistance programs,\" Diaz-Perez said. \n\n                    In July, Nicor Inc. predicted that its customers,\n                    located primarily in the Chicago suburbs, could see\n                    their bill rise by as much as $200 over last year for\n                    the same six-month period. But Nicor expects to\n                    revise that prediction upward this week, said Lee\n                    Haines, a spokesman for Nicor. \n\n                    Haines noted that the October gas cost for Nicor\n                    customers is 63 cents per therm, up from 51.5\n                    cents per therm for September. And the October\n                    cost per therm is 70 percent higher than last year's\n                    cost of 37 cents per therm, Haines said. \n\n                    Said Marty Cohen, executive vice president of the \n                     Citizens Utility Board in Chicago: \"Most\n                    consumers are unaware of what they are in for this\n                    winter. They haven't taken note that gas prices are\n                    dramatically higher than they were a year ago.\" \n\n                    Cohen suggested that consumers study the gas\n                    companies' varied payment options to determine\n                    whether spreading payments out evenly over the\n                    year would make economic sense for their families. \n\n                    As expensive as it's likely to be to heat a\n                    Chicago-area home this winter, prices are higher in\n                    other areas, says Donato Eassey, first vice\n                    president for natural gas research at Merrill Lynch in\n                    Houston. Nationally, Eassey said, residential prices\n                    for natural gas have escalated 88 percent over last\n                    year. \n\n                    \"If they are only increasing 48 percent in the\n                    Chicago area, they've done a good job of keeping\n                    costs down,\" Eassey said. \n\n                    Eassey also said that even if the predicted price\n                    increases occur, the cost of natural gas is still\n                    much lower than it has been in the past. \n\n                    Consumers enjoyed a significant decrease in gas\n                    prices between mid-1984 and 1999, with prices on\n                    average down 2 percent or 3 percent, though the\n                    consumer price index stayed steady, Eassey\n                    noted. \n\n                    \"We've been spoiled by cheap energy,\" Eassey\n                    said. \"It's still the best bargain in town.\" \n\n                    But Eassey noted that rising prices appear to be\n                    encouraging gas companies to push for exploration,\n                    which in the long run could increase supply and\n                    keep the lid on prices. \n\n                    When prices were low, Eassey said, \"we just didn't\n                    have the drill bit turning to the right often enough.\n                    There was not enough incentive to invest in new\n                    prospects.\" \n\n                    Last year, the number of rigs drilling for natural gas\n                    was 597; now the number is up to 806, a 35 percent\n                    increase, he said. \n\n                    Severin Borenstein, the director of the University\n                    of California at Berkeley's Energy Institute, agreed\n                    that high energy prices are likely to encourage\n                    energy companies to look for new sources of\n                    supply. \n\n                    \"The politics are such that the higher prices are\n                    going to add fuel to the debate over drilling for fossil\n                    fuels in North America,\" especially in normally\n                    sacrosanct areas such as Alaska, Borenstein said.",

(Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)\nThe judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).\nOur attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  \nThough the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.\nInterestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  \nThe judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  \nAs a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.\nThe judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., \"why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info,\" etc.\nFrom today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  \nIn related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in \"serious negotitations.\"",

Gray Davis \nclaims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May \n2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. \n\nOf the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from \nthe October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC \nlacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent \nSystem Operator.  \n   \nThat leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could \npotentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. \n\nTalks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in \nunpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC \nadministrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will \nlikely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis \nexpects. \n\nDavis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., \"with one goal, \nand that is to bring back $9 billion.\" \n\nNearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO \ndocuments show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, \nfor example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. \n\nDavid Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general \nmanager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but \nconceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. \n\nDavis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork \nfor the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from \ncorporate energy suppliers. \n\nBut during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press \nsecretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about \ngetting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated \nby FERC. \n\nDavis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators \novercharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. \n\nState Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation \ninto Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on \"shaky \ncalculations.\" \n\nTo come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices \nreceived by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been \nexpected under competitive market conditions. \n\nThe ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at \ntimes about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices \nin the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with \nair-quality rules. \n\nThe ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern \nborder, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the \nfuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. \n\nThe ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's \"Big Five\" power \nsuppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the \nconclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. \n\nThe ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest \nutilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid \noperator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the \ndocuments. \n\nThe ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed \namounts between May 2000 and February:",

He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again.\" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down t! he! stretch.Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matc! hu! p for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.Dedric Ward, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.Lamar Smith, RB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.Jerome P! at! hon, WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee s! ur! gery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. Warrick Dunn, RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. Duce Staley, RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on ! 11! carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. Joe Nedney, K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. Erron Kinney, TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.Eddie George, RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. Steve McNair, QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. Damon Jones, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. Fred Taylor, RB JAC - High! S! hrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. \"All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,\" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. \"It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week.\" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis Northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. Todd Heap, TE BAL - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. Terry Allen, RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. Elvis Grbac, QB BAL! -! South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. \"I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,\" Grbac said Monday. \"There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see.\" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.   Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. Trung Canidate, RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. \"I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,\" coach Mike Martz said. \"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play.\" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.   J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/23/01Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. \"Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing f! or! me because I was able to get treatment every day,\" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . \"I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close.\" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. \"I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,\" Martz said. \"I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play.\" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

We invite you  to visit \nCal-Tax Online (http://www.caltax.org) for more  information on this and \nother Cal-Tax activities.? If you wish more  information about Cal-Tax's \ne-Alerts or Cal-Tax Online, please contact Greg Turner at  greg@caltax.org? \nIf you wish not  to be included on future Cal-Tax e-Alerts, please contact \nBetty Rickard at  betty@caltax.org and your address will  be removed from our \ndistribution list. \n\n\nMay 8,  2001?\n\nTo:????????????Cal-Tax?Board  of Directors and?Interested?Parties???\nFrom:????????Ron  Roach, Communications Director??\nSubject:????Update  of Windfall Profits Tax  Legislation?\n\nThe following is advance  Caltaxletter coverage of  the May 7 California \nLegislature's actions on two bills that would impose  \"windfall profits\" \ntaxes on producers of electricity:??\n?\nSENATE APPROVES \u0001&WINDFALL PROFITS\u00018 TAX AS ROLLING BLACKOUTS  HIT??????\n\nNearly coinciding with rolling blackouts plaguing  California for the first \ntime since mid-March, the Senate on Monday approved a  \u0001&windfall profits\u00018 tax \non energy producers (SB 1X, Soto). Critics said  the measure establishes a \nperverse tax incentive not to sell power in California  and will reduce \nelectricity supply even further, increasing prospects of future  blackouts.??\n\nTwenty-five  Democrats voted \u0001&aye\u00018 on SB 1X, while 12 Republicans voted \nagainst it.  Because the bill did not pass with 27 votes, or two-thirds of \nthe Senate as  required by Proposition 13, there will likely be a court \nchallenge on this  point.\n\nMeanwhile,  just hours earlier, the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee \napproved a  slightly different version of a \u0001&windfall profits\u00018 tax (AB 128X,  \nCorbett), despite the fact that the bill was substantially amended at the  \nhearing.\n\nSB  1X imposes a 100 percent excise tax on sales of electricity at a price \nabove  $80 per megawatt-hour. It also establishes a refundable tax credit \nequal to the  amount of revenue generated by the tax.\n\nAB 128X establishes a retroactive (to January 1,  2001) sliding-scale tax of \n50 percent of gross receipts on electricity sales  over $60 per \nmegawatt-hour; 70 percent of the gross receipts of sales over $90  per \nmegawatt-hour, and 90 percent of gross receipts of sales over $120 per  \nmegawatt-hour. The rate of tax can be changed \u0001&from time to time\u00018 by the  \nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission. ?The bill will likely tax sales not  \nmade in California, because it defines \u0001&sales of electricity to a retailer\u00018 \nin  California to be the higher of the ratio of sales in California to the \ntotal  sales or percentage of total electricity sales everywhere, using a \nratio  of total sales everywhere in the year 2000 to sales in California in \nthe year  2000.?\n\nDebate in the Senate was hotter than the 95-degree  temperature outside. \nDemocrat Senator Steve Peace, who is generally given credit  for pushing the \nelectricity deregulation bill through the Legislature in 1996,  became highly \nemotional in denouncing energy producers.?\n\nContinuing to blame the California crisis on the  Federal Energy Regulation \nCommission (FERC), as well as Harvey Rosenfield\u0001,s  Proposition 9, which \nsought to unravel deregulation in 1998 and caused a  two-year delay in \nconstruction of additional power plants, Senator Peace called  SB 1X the \n\u0001&only reasonable alternative.\u00018? He said it will bring competition to the  \nmarket with rules and \u0001&a referee who will blow the whistle.\u00018 He described \nFERC  as \u0001&the proverbial cop in the donut shop who refuses to enforce the \nlaw\u00018 and  limit what wholesalers can charge.?\n\nRepublican Senator Ray Haynes said the tax would not  bring additional \nelectricity to Californians. \u0001&We are going to make sure by  passing this bill \nthat the lights will go out,\u00018 he said.??\n\nDemocrat Senator Debra Bowen said the prospect of  taxing excess profits \n\u0001&will grab (energy producers) by the horns and their  hearts and minds will \nfollow.\u00018?\n\nRepublican Senator Tom McClintock said the tax would  cut supplies of \nelectricity, noting that other states, such as Texas and Nevada,  are \nbuilding, or will build, power plants to serve California with investments  \nthat benefit those states\u0001, economies, not California\u0001,s. \u0001&To make electricity  \ncheap, we have to make it plentiful. This is a very wrong step in a very \nwrong  direction,\u00018 he said.?\n\nAt the Assembly committee hearing, numerous speakers  sought to testify for \nand against the bill. However, Democrat Assembly Member  Helen Thomson \n(chosen by Committee Chair Ellen Corbett to preside instead of the  \nRepublican vice-chair, which in itself was unusual) limited testimony to two  \nwitnesses on each side.?\n\nSpeaking for the tax were Jean Ross, executive  director of the California \nBudget Project, and Lenny Goldberg, of the California  Tax Reform \nAssociation, organizations funded largely by public employee unions  or \nliberal-leaning foundations that generally oppose tax relief and support  \nincreased government spending. Ms. Ross urged immediate action, saying \nconsumers  will be paying 1.5 percent of their income on power purchases in \nthe next year.  Mr. Goldberg called the proposal a viable and realistic \nsolution, which he said  he hopes is constitutional.??\n\nProviding opposition testimony were Carrie-Lee Coke,  representing the \nCalifornia Manufacturers and Technology Association, and Steven  Kelly of the \nIndependent Energy Producers.?  Ms. Coke said the bill is a disincentive to \nmore supply and will make the  current crisis worse. She said it also applies \nto the cogeneration operations of  California manufacturers. Mr. Kelly told \nthe committee that the bill jeopardizes  plans for as much as $10 billion in \nprivate capital investment in new California  power plants.??\n\nA number of others were allowed to state their  affiliations and their \npositions on the bill. Among supporters were the  California Labor Federation \nand the California Public Interest Research Group.  Opposition included the \nCalifornia Chamber of Commerce, InterGen, and BP?Amoco.?\n\nCommittee Member Elaine Alquist asked to be a co-author  of the bill, saying \nit is about time \u0001&we did something.\u00018??AB 128X was  approved by a 5-0 vote, \nwith Republicans abstaining. Assembly Member Mark Wyland  said he abstained \nbecause he believes that while California is being gouged by  high energy \nprices, the bill is anti-free market and incentives are needed to  develop \nmore power to avoid blackouts.?\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Gray Davis \u0001&is open to the idea\u00018 of  such a tax, but has \nnot endorsed either bill, said his press secretary, Steve  Maviglio. \u0001&It just \ndepends on the bill.\u00018??????\n\n\n?\n - e-alert3.gif",

This means we need to reschedule their HLH MW's that was pre-scheduled today for Jan. 2nd.  I have told them I will give them weekly updates regarding the power availability.  We can deliver for all of January, but please let me know if anything changes, so I can let them know in advance.

In addition,\nplease find a copy of the Commentary on the Bridge.\n\nAs many of you know, various working groups prepared amendments to the ISDA\nMaster Agreements to be effected through the use of a 2001 ISDA Master\nAgreement Protocol.  In connection with this effort, the Structural Issues\nWorking Group prepared the Cross-Agreement Bridge.  Following meetings of\nthe Strategic Documentation Review Task Force in late July and discussions\nin August and September, it was felt that the Protocol approach was too\ncomplicated, from an operational and logistical perspective, given the\nnature and the number of the proposed amendments.  Accordingly, it was\ndecided that the four euro annexes would be separated from the Protocol and\ncompiled in their own 2001 Euro Protocol.  The 2001 Euro Protocol is now\navailable on our website and the adherence period ends on November 30, 2001.\nAnnexes 1 to 9 of the Protocol have been prepared as a Form of Amendment to\nthe ISDA Master Agreements.  The Form of Amendment, and the Commentary, will\nbe published on ISDA's website late this week or early next week.  Work is\nscheduled to begin on a new Master Agreement and kick-off meetings to\ndiscuss the new draft Master Agreement will be held in London later this\nyear.  Details will be announced to the Documentation Committee soon.\n\nAs for the Bridge, it was felt that we should publish this on our website as\nwell.  Accordingly, I have attached the drafts for your review.  Please note\nthat the \"option to disapply\" was deleted in this draft, primarily because\nthe version of the Bridge considered by ISDA's netting counsel in late 2000\ndid not include such an option.\n\nI would be grateful if you could review the attached documents by Friday,\nNovember 2.  I would like to publish these on our website on Monday,\nNovember 5.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me at 212-332-1203 if you have any\nquestions. Thank you very much for your consideration.\n\nKimberly Summe\n\n\n\n - Marked up version.DOC \n - Commentary on Cross-Agreement Bridge.DOC",

It will be heard again \ntomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a \nchance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose \nunless significantly amended.\nThe Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an \"informational\" \nhearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be \nheard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to \nsupport/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the \nbest bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't \navailable electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute \nthen.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, \nsince it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the \nSpeaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any \nagreement in his bill (82XX).\nThe original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most \nbelieve that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.\nThe Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It \nwill likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it \nkills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for \nthat portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.\nBurton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General \nFund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the \nnext day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting \nit behind the scenes).\n\nWhat people don't know:\nWhether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by \nFriday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his \nsignature. \nWhether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the \nLegislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not \npostpone).\nWhether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature \nwill fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to \npostpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on \nthe energy legislation at the same time.\n\nOdds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not \nget the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n\nSacramento is one goofy place.",

Also, thank \nyou for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application \nand talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and \nstaff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to \nattend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the \ncareer I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be \nable to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my \nexperiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the \nGMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have \nproven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. \nEnron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the \nmany people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  \n Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and \nit was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in \nTexas, such as myself.  \n\nRegards,\n\nBen Rogers",

PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.\n\n2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.\n\n3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.\n\n4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.\n\nObviously this is a small list.

Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. \n\nTo facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and \"Hot Button\" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  \n\nI trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.\n\nregards, \n\nBarry Tycholiz",

      "content": "Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. \nLouis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)\nhas been the only pipeline into this market.  \n\n\nNGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis\n\nNatural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new \n47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois \nPower's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored \nby a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will \nadd at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis \nmarket. \n\n\"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing \nstrategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets \ncurrently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by \nadding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,\" said Richard D. \nKinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. \n\nThe new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois \nPower's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is \nscheduled for completion in June of 2002. \n\nNGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and \nstorage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, \nwhich will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In \naddition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation \nagreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf \nCoast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. \n\nThe NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area \nthat until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company \n[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, \npresident of Illinois Power. \"This new connection to Illinois Power's system \nwill help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the \nmetro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point \nto service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the \narea. \n\n\"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy \nprovides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,\" said Deb \nMacdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest \nfrom other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season \nwill determine the final scope of the project. \n\n\"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the \nSt. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of \ninterest,\" said Macdonald. \"We anticipate a strong response, however, given \nthe size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power \ngeneration.\" \n\nInterested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business \ndevelopment, at (630) 691-3347.",

A major goal that is shared by the GSPP alumni\n> board\n> and the school is to host policy forums that attract top academics, policy\n> makers, and public attention as not only a good public service, but at good \nPR\n> for the school and its mission.  Since electricity deregulation in CA is on\n> the\n> front page of all major newspapers this summer, the Dean and I are \ninterested\n> in\n> putting together an electricity policy forum.  I would need your contacts,\n> political sense, and perhaps some financial support from Enron to make this\n> work.  Do you like the idea and would you be willing to help in some of \nthese\n> ways?  I think it is in the interest of Enron to advance reasoned debate \nwith\n> the backing of the independent/objective GSPP against what is already a \nmajor\n> emotional/political backlash.\n>\n> On a totally unrelated issue, I spoke with Tim Belden about a position in \nthe\n> Enron govt affairs group working with the trading desk.  I guess the VP for\n> the\n> West, Kaufman, is supposed to call me.  If the job is really to understand \nand\n> follow RTO developments and their interaction with energy prices it seems a\n> perfect fit with what I've been doing.

This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluated, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transactions via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes, and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of various risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management framework.  \n\nManagement and employees are responsible for complying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Following an initial transiton period, various individuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk management framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an example of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Cassandra Schultz, cassandra.schultz@enron.com, 713-853-0429 who will put you in touch with the appropriate Risk Assessment & Control representative.

The mantra must leave\n   your hands within 96 hours.\n\n   You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is\n   true even if you are not superstitious.\n\n   Instructions for life in the new millennium from\n   the Dalai Lama:\n\n   1. Take into account that great love and great\n   achievements involve great risk.\n\n   2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.\n\n   3. Follow the three Rs: Respect for self, respect\n   for others, responsibility for all your actions.\n\n   4. Remember that not getting what you want is\n   sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.\n\n   5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them\n   properly.\n\n   6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great\n   friendship.\n\n   7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take\n   immediate steps to correct it.\n\n   8. Spend some time alone every day.\n\n   9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of\n   your values.\n\n   10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best\n   answer.\n\n   11. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get\n   older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.\n\n   12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the\n   foundation for your life.\n\n   13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only\n   with the current situation. Don't bring up the past.\n\n   14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve\n  immortality.\n\n   15. Be gentle with the earth.\n\n   16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been\n   before.\n\n   17. Remember that the best relationship is one in\n   which your love for each\n   other exceeds your need for each other.\n\n   18. Judge your success by what you had to give up\n   in order to get it.\n\n   19. Approach love and cooking with reckless\n   abandon.\n\n   Do not keep this message. The mantra must leave\n   your hands within 96 hours.\n\n   You will get a very pleasant surprise (this is\n   true even if you are not superstitious)\n   if you send it to:\n\n  0-4 people: Your life will improve slightly.\n\n   5-9 people: Your life will improve to your liking.\n\n   9-14 people: You will have at least 5 surprises in\n   the next 3 weeks.\n\n   15 people and above: Your life will improve\n   drastically and everything you\n   ever dreamed of will begin to take shape",

Please let me know the number of attendees when you find out so that we can provide adequate copies for those needing them.

APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  \n\nAs to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (\"RECs\"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. \n\nTrading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  \n\nTXU Energy Trading \nBP Energy Company\nReliant Energy Services, Inc.\nAquila Power Corporation\nMorgan Stanley capitral Group\nConstellation Power Source\nFPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.\nAmerican Electic Power Service Corporation\nMirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP\nCalpine Energy Servicces LP\nDynegy Marketing & Trade\nLCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority\n\nalong with a couple of incumbent utilities:\n\nSan Antonio City Public Service\nReliant HL&P\n\nIf you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSteffes, James D.  \nSent:\tWednesday, January 30, 2002 8:41 AM\nTo:\tGilbert-smith, Doug; Day, Smith L.; Sager, Elizabeth; Portz, David\nCc:\tWill, Lloyd; Presto, Kevin M.; Bailey, Debra; Haedicke, Mark E.\nSubject:\tUBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs\n\nUBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.\n\nBasically, my understanding is the following --\n\n1.\tPUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer\n2.\tERCOT ISO Information\n\tQSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE \n\tLSE [Portz, David]   N/A \n\tWholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement \n\tOther [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  \n3.\tAPX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially\n4.\tOther\n\nGiven the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.

      "content": "Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!\n\nThis is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of \nCorporate Payroll. You may notice some changes in the way information is \nreflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.\n\nWhat\u0001,s Different?\n? Your \u0001+home\u0001, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay advice. \nThis is your department number as designated in the HR and financial modules \nof SAP.\n\n? Any earnings descriptions that start with a \u0001+P\u0001, represent earning types \nreported in the prior period. For instance, if you reported vacation time for \nthe July 1st-15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay \nadvice as \u0001+PVacation\u0001,.\n\n? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instead \nof as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions will \nremain itemized in the deduction section.\n\n? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year\u0001)to-date \ntotals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the \nyear-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This \nchange will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your \npay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year \nwill reflect your earnings by company).\n\n? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick \nday, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the \nrelated dollar amount will be included in the \u0001+Salary\u0001, earnings type. \n\n? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll \ncontact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555\n\n\n\nPayroll FAQ\u0001,s\n\nMy paycheck has a line called \u0001&other deductions\u00018, what does that stand for?\nThere is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For \nsome employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to \nprint.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions and \nprints them on one line \u0001) titled \u0001&other deductions\u00018.  The detail of all \ndeductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intranet \nat eHRonline.enron.com.\n\nWhat do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?\nThese definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at \nhrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.\n\nWhy is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?\nOvertime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected in \nthe next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the \nJuly 1st \u0001)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay advice \nas \u0001+POvertime\u0001,.\n\nWhat is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?\nFor year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit is \napplied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to \nanother Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amount \nwithheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FICA \nwill be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.\n\nWhat federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock \noptions?\nThere is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This \ncan be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form \nrequesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , select \nEnron Payroll  from the side index).",

It was pushed on August 30, so \nif in a future order the Commission were to require refunds, they would be \ncalculated beginning October 29th. \n---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 10/05/2000 11:43 AM \n---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  \"Ronald Carroll\" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com>                           \n10/05/2000 07:51 AM\n\t\n\nTo: <mary.hain@enron.com>, <smara@enron.com>, \n<seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com>, <cfi1@tca-us.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Electric Power Plus Article re FERC Chairman Hoecker's Congressional \nTestimony\n\n\nLaw changes needed for retroactive refunds\n\nFERC'S Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority\n_______________________________________________\nDate: October 2, 2000 -\n\n\nFERC Chairman James Hoecker (D) told a congressional panel that the \ncommission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against \nmarket power in a competitive environment. Hoecker also urged the congressmen \nto give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility \nindustry's transition to competition.\n\nHoecker's plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California, where \nsome state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after \nprices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this \nsummer. Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will \nconsider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the state's bulk \npower markets, it is clear that currently, the commission does not have that \nauthority to do so retroactively.\n\n\"The [Federal Power Act] would have to be changed,\" a FERC staffer says.\n\nFor its own study -- which began in August -- Hoecker claimed that the \ncommission, if proven necessary, would consider ordering refunds if market \nparticipants were indeed price gouging. However, the Federal Power Act (FPA) \n-- the law that gives the commission much of its authority -- does not \nconsider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is \nprobably needed to see if the commission can do that.\n\n\"If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, \nwe will do so,\" Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept. \n21. \"If market power is being exercised, we will respond accordingly, by \nrevoking or modifying market-based rates or reassuring the basis upon which \nwe grant them. We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA, if \nrefunds are justified by record evidence. However, the FPA defines the \ncommission's authority, and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures \nwith California (and other states).\"\n\nCurrently, the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions \nmade 60 days after the commission initiates an investigation, which in this \ncase would be Oct. 13. However, the law makes no mention of retroactive \nratemaking, and FERC officials admit that to do so, the law needs to be \nchanged.\n\n\"Based upon what I know, the authority of the commission to issue refunds for \nany period before 60 days following our [investigation] order is highly \nproblematic,\" Commissioner William Massey (D) told Electric Power Alert. \n\"There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that, it would be \nunlawful and we would need legislation to do that.\"\n\nThe Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN), held a \nmid-afternoon Sept. 21 hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a \nsevere energy crisis this winter. The committee heard testimony from Hoecker, \nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nAdministrator Carol Browner.\n\nMuch of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets, but both \nRichardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for \nfailing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year. Richardson \nexpressed his \"disappointment\" that nothing passed, while Hoecker claimed \nthat FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power.\n\n\"Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United \nStates under the same rules for non-discriminatory open access and comparable \nservice,\" Hoecker said. \"The commission's open access rules are not binding \non the part of the nation's transmission system . . . owned or controlled by \nentities other than public utilities. Open access over the facilities of \npublic power and other non-public utilities would promote greater competition \nin wholesale markets, by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers \nand sellers.\"\n\nHoecker pointed to FERC's investigation into bulk power markets and \nCalifornia's energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives \nclear legislative direction, FERC will extremely limited in what it could do \nto solve the market problems.\n\n\"Congress, too, has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to \nobtain the energy they need at reasonable prices,\" Hoecker said. \"Most \ncritically, events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting \nelectricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition. \nFederal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate \ninvestment in generation and transmission facilities, and higher levels of \nreliability which is crucial to the digital economy.\"\n\nThe chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate \nregional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability \nstandards. Currently, the House is considering a bill that would make the \ncommission a federal backstop for reliability, but most congressional sources \ndo not expect the bill to pass (see related story).\n\n\n\n\n\n_source: Electric Power Alert\n_date: October 2, 2000\n_issue: Vol. 10, No. 20\n_title: FERC's Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority\n, Inside Washington Publishers",

      "content": "Greg:\n\nIn August I submitted an idea to Enron's ThinkBank  \"Idea Vault\"  for a new business opportunity for Enron. My idea is to develop a new commodity market for exchanging wireless spectrum rights. The idea is categorized under \"Commodities\" and is accompanied by a report which explains in more detail the idea, background information, market conditions and why it's a tremendous opportunity for Enron.\n\nIt's been 2 months since I submitted the idea, but I haven't yet received a response from anyone who may have evaluated it. I'm contacting you now for two reasons. First, it is my understanding that the Net Works group develops and launches ideas like this. And second, it's my effort to \"jump start\" the review process, for fears that the idea may have fallen between the cracks somewhere in the \"Idea Vault\" process. Included below is the preface to my report which introduces the idea for trading wireless spectrum. The entire report can be accessed and printed from the Idea Vault site, or I could send the report document electronically if that's easier.\n\nIf it's not appropriate for me to have sent you this email directly, then I sincerely apologize for the mistake. If you're typically not the person who would review an idea like this, again please accept my apology, and recommend who you think that person might be.\n\nThanks for your consideration,\n\n - Jack Franzino\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWireless Spectrum - Creating a New Commodity Market\n\nOne cornerstone of Enron's success is its ability to create new markets where none existed before?\nnot just dominate markets, or compete for increased market share, but actually create new markets.\nContinuing that innovative spirit, wireless spectrum presents another opportunity to create a new market,\nsince no secondary market currently exists for exchanging this valuable resource. The demand for wireless\ncommunications continues to skyrocket; however, there is a limited supply of spectrum available for\ncommercial use. The Federal Communications Commission is in the initial stages of change in its regulatory\npolicies governing spectrum allocation. Mix these regulatory changes into a market of tight supply and high\ndemand, and the commodity trading of wireless spectrum becomes an extraordinary opportunity for Enron.",

That would mean a loss of some 3.5\nBCF/D of injection demand in summer of 2002. Not surprising, we are probably\ngoing to revise our prices down and throw out the V bottom and grab a long,\nwide U bottom .. no $3 prices for 2002. You know what we really mean.

The recommendations, released \nyesterday, are likely to serve as the state's initial bargaining position as \nit seeks to reopen a power-supply contract that one Maharashtra government \nreached with Enron-led Dabhol Power Co. in 1993 and another renegotiated in \n1996. Enron has indicated it is willing to reopen the contract yet again.\nThe $3 billion project has been watched closely by U.S. officials, since \nDabhol is India's largest foreign investment to date, and the U.S. \nExport-Import Bank is a major lender. Yesterday's report slams the Dabhol \ncontracts as based on \"extremely questionable assumptions\" about oil prices, \nforeign-exchange rates and the state's demand for power. With a second phase \nexpected to bring the project to 2,184 megawatts of capacity shortly, the \nreport concludes, the state couldn't afford to sell power from Dabhol at the \nlevels needed to make the project economical, even if the state's electricity \nboard made years' worth of distribution reforms overnight. \nThe 200-page report recommends converting the project's dollar-based equity \nand debt to Indian rupees, reducing Dabhol's return on equity to 16% from as \nmuch as 39% and putting a moratorium on debt payments until the state can \nafford to buy more of the plant's power. The five-member panel, which \nincluded a top Indian banker and several energy specialists, also suggested \nthe project's liquefied-natural-gas facility sell gas to others. Dabhol is \nthe sole user of the gas, which is shipped from the Arabian Gulf, and \nMaharashtra is responsible for paying for most of it no matter how much is \nused. \nA Dabhol spokesman said the company hasn't seen a copy of the report and \ndeclined to comment. Dabhol has disputed the 39% figure, and denied that its \npower rates are unusually high. \nThe power project's lenders, meanwhile, are expected to meet next week to \nconvey their views to Enron. One official of a lending bank said lenders are \nmore concerned with the power company's immediate difficulties getting paid \nthan with the prospects of having to renegotiate terms, though any new \ncontract would need to be approved unanimously. \nDabhol's lenders include the Japanese government, the Industrial Development \nBank of India, ICICI Ltd. and scores of other Indian and international banks. \nEnron holds 65% of Dabhol's equity, with Bechtel Group Inc., General Electric \nCo. and the state electricity board splitting the rest.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 13, 2001\nHouston Chronicle\nUtility owes Enron $570 million \nCalifornia's PG&E in bankruptcy \nBy MICHAEL DAVIS \nCopyright 2001 Houston Chronicle \nEnron Corp. is owed $570 million by bankrupt utility Pacific Gas & Electric \nCo., the Houston company has disclosed in a letter to the utility's \nbankruptcy trustee. \nOther Houston companies have said they are owed large amounts, but Enron's \ndisclosure was the first indication to Wall Street that the bankrupt utility \nowes the Houston company such a substantial amount, said M. Carol Coale, \nenergy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston. \n\"They told the investment community that their California receivables were \nnot material and that they were fully reserved against them,\" Coale said. \nEven so, \"This is not going to be received favorably.\" \nThis disclosure came as Enron became one of the companies named late \nWednesday to the creditors' committee for San Francisco-based Pacific Gas & \nElectric's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The committee represents the parties with \nthe largest claims in a bankruptcy case. \nA letter to the trustee overseeing the case disclosing how much Enron is owed \nwas part of Enron's effort to secure a seat on the committee appointed by \nU.S. Trustee Linda Stanley, a Justice Department official. \nMark Palmer, an Enron spokesman in Houston, declined to comment Thursday on \nwhat Enron is owed. He said Enron has taken adequate reserves to protect its \nbalance sheet against any outstanding debts owed it by Pacific Gas & \nElectric. \nEnron's shares closed Thursday at $57.30, down $1.21 per share. The stock \nmarkets are closed today in observance of Good Friday. \nPacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection one week ago, listing \nassets of more than $24 billion and debts of $18 billion, including more than \n$9 billion in uncollected costs for power purchases. The utility's creditor \nlist is so long and varied that creditors are expected to form numerous \nsubgroups based on the types of claims they hold against the company. \nThe case is expected to take months, if not years, to settle. It is the \nlargest utility bankruptcy ever filed and the third largest business \nbankruptcy in U.S. history, based on assets, behind Texaco in 1987 and \nFinancial Corporation of America in 1998. \nPacific Gas & Electric sells electricity and natural gas to the San Francisco \nand Northern California areas. The company said it filed Chapter 11 because \nnegotiations with California over how to resolve the state's power crisis \nwere going nowhere. \nEnron is scheduled to make its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. \nEnron is expected to report 45 cents per share for the quarter, up from 40 \ncents per share in the first quarter of last year, according to earnings \nestimates compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial in Boston. \n\"We are still confident that we will earn $1.70 to $1.75 per share for the \nyear,\" Palmer said. \nHe would not specify how much Enron has reserved to cover Pacific Gas & \nElectric's debt. \nThe prevailing wisdom had been that Enron's exposure in California was \nminimal because it does not own power plants there. Companies such as Reliant \nEnergy and Dynegy, which own power plants in California, have been forced to \nsell power with no guarantee of payment. \nAlthough Enron is one of the larger creditors of Pacific Gas & Electric, \nothers are owed substantially more. \nThe largest unsecured creditor is Bank of New York, with a $2.2 billion \nclaim. \nThe California Power Exchange, which once served as the marketplace for power \nsales in the state's deregulated power markets, holds a claim against Pacific \nGas & Electric of $1.9 billion. The Power Exchange filed for bankruptcy prior \nto Pacific Gas & Electric's filing. \nEnron was dealt another setback in California earlier this week when a \nfederal judge ordered the company to keep supplying low-cost power to \nCalifornia's state university systems after Enron tried to shift \nresponsibility for buying the school's power to the state's troubled \nutilities. \nThe school systems argued that if Enron were allowed to dump them as \"direct \naccess\" customers who receive power bought and resold directly by the \ncompany, they would lose the ability to manage their power most efficiently, \nwhich could cost the taxpayers of California millions. \nEnron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's \nruling in the lawsuit brought by the California State University and \nUniversity of California systems. \nEnron said it is honoring all terms of the contracts, but the company added \nthat it believes it has the legal right to shift the school systems back into \nthe hands of the utilities, a spokeswoman said. \n\n\n\n\nTexas energy company owed hundreds of millions in California\n\n04/13/2001\nAssociated Press Newswires\nCopyright 2001.

In a span of \njust eight years the Enron controversy has repeated itself with a reversal of \nroles.\nFirst it was the Sharad Pawar-led Congress government that went all out to \npersuade the US energy major to set up shop in Maharashtra. The general \nelection that followed changed Pawars fortunes. \nA Sena-BJP government came to power but not before painting Enron black \nthanks to its Rs 64 crore expenditure on `education that had become an \nelection issue back then. \nSo the first thing that the Sena-BJP government did after assuming power was \nto scrap the Enron project. Subsequently the `review committee headed by \nKirit Parikh, Professor Emeritus, IGIDR, once a bitter critic of Enron, came \nup with a new look power purchase agreement. The new PPA cobbled together \nphase I and II of the Dabhol Power Company. \nThe next election was in 1999. By this time Pawar had deserted the Congress. \nThe Sena-BJP alliance bit the dust at the hustings and a paralysed Congress \nwas forced to join hands with Sharad Pawar. All for the sake of a \npower-sharing arrangement in the state. \nBy this time Enrons partner, the Maharashtra State Electricty Board, had \nweakened further and it wanted the state government to help it pay Enrons \nbills. The equally bankrupt state government was obviously unable to spare \nthe funds. \nThe situation was perfectly ripe to rake up the Enron controversy. Once \nagain. Whats more, it seemed politically correct too. The Vilasrao Deshmukh \ngovernment did exactly this. It installed Vinay Bansal, a no-nonsense \nbureaucrat known for taking on ministers, as MSEB chairman to give the Enron \ndispute some much needed credibility. \nBansal caught Enron napping when it failed to supply electricity as per the \nMSEBs demand. MSEB invoked the PPA clause and slapped Rs 402 crore penalty on \nthe American utility. This provided the trigger for the fight which was \nwaiting to happen. \nMeanwhile, the state governments review committee led by Madhav Godbole \nsubmitted its report and recommended a renegotiation of the project. \nInterestingly, this committee too had Parikh as a member. His inclusion had \nraised many eyebrows and N D Patil, convenor of the ruling coalition in the \nstate criticised Parikh for his flip-flop on the project. \nIn the end, Parikh kept himself away from the committee. The committee has \nobserved that the then political leadership had shown ``great haste for \nsigning the current PPA. \nIt noted that even the cost of constructing a jetty at Dabhol has been \nincluded in the cost of power by the DPC. The committee wants to delink \ndollar-rupee equation for tariff to lower the bill. \nA large chunk of the loans taken by Enron have a bigger foreign currency \ncomponent and the committee wants the Indian currency component in these \nloans to be increased. \nInterestingly, Enron has preferred to remain silent on the Godbole committee \nreport. It has already invoked the political force majeure clause, has \ninvoked the state and Centre guarantee and even announced its decision to go \nin for arbitration. \nThe next twist in this longdrawn-out tale depends on Enrons reaction to the \nreport. However, experts feel that the Dabhol case clearly highlights some of \nthe major failures in past decision-making in the power sector. Firstly, \nbefore inviting IPPs, necessary reforms like setting up of independent \nregulatory bodies should have been in place. \nThe problem of realisation of dues from defaulting customers and poor \nmaintenance of transmission and distribution systems require that reform \nshould begin at the distribution end, so that any supplier of power has the \nassurance that dues will be collected and payments effected for power sold. \nThere is also need to correct the imbalance in terms of base-load versus \npeak-load power capacity. \nThe SEBs supply power to farmers and domestic users at ridiculously \nsubsidised prices. Moreover, many customers do not pay their bills and like \nother SEBs, MSEB too is unable to initiate action to collect these dues. \nThe T&D losses too, which include pilferage of power, have gone up \nsubstantially in recent years. In this situation, the more MSEB purchases \nfrom Dabhol the more it loses through subsidies and T&D.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\n\nPower sale: Godbole wants DPC freed\nRenni Abraham MUMBAI\n\n04/13/2001\nBusiness Standard\n1\nCopyright (c) Business Standard\n\nThe Madhav Godbole committee has recommended to the Maharashtra government \nthat the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company should be allowed to sell power \nto entities other than the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). It has \nalso recommended that the tariff should be benchmarked to the lowest cost of \nsupply of power from gas-based projects elsewhere, and restructured into a \ntwo-part tariff. \n\"The committee recommends that the DPC tariff be re-defined using principles \ncontained in the government of India guidelines and the availability-based \ntariff order of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, to convert it \ninto a two-part tariff but limit equity return substantially,\" the report \nsays.\nFurther, the committee has recommended that the equity returns for the \nredefined DPC tariff be defined in rupee terms, rather than in dollar terms. \nIt has also suggested that the escrow agreement with DPC should be scrapped, \nas the current agreement \"would soon give rise to a situation where virtually \nall of MSEB's revenues would be escrowed to meet DPC's payments, leaving \nlittle for wages and fuel, let alone additional power purchase.\" \nThe report, \"Energy review, Maharashtra and the DPC issue,\" was submitted to \nthe state legislature on Thursday by minister for energy Padmasinh Patil. \nBusiness Standard obtained a copy of the 198-page report. Godbole panel \nsuggestions \nThe second part of the report will focus on the future course of action for \nreforms in the state energy sector. It is to be submitted to the state \ngovernment on May 10. \nThe first report recommends that DPC be allowed to sell power if it \ndesignates a certain capacity for sale outside the MSEB system and \"the fixed \ncharges on account of MSEB are reduced in proportion to this designated \ncapacity.\" Alternatively, if DPC felt it has prospects of earning better \nreturn if it had the contractual freedom to sell power to other parties \ndirectly, it could do so only if it agreed to relieve MSEB of all its \ncontractual obligations relating to the power plant, the committee said. \nThe committee said that only benchmarking of the tariff against lowest gas \nbased power projects elsewhere would make third party sale to other states \nand the power trading corporation possible. Otherwise negotiations with DPC \nwill prove futile, the report states. \nSignificantly, the committee has argued that in view of the un-sustainability \nof the DPC project, the power major should forego a portion of the return on \nits equity to make the project viable.In other words it wants the current \nrate of return of equity of 16 per cent to be lowered. \n\"The maturity of the debt of DPC should be increased preferably to 15 years, \nwith an initial moratorium of five years. An indicative interest rate for \nsuch debt could be 12 per cent (in rupee terms which would be around six per \ncent in dollar terms). In case such maturity is not possible for foreign \nloans, the foreign debt should be converted to rupee debt and restructured \naccordingly. Concomitantly, the equity may be restructured into deferred \npreference capital so that the impact on tariff is felt only in later years,\" \nthe report said. \nIt also makes a case for separating Enron's LNG project from DPC. As a \nseparate facility, the gas could be marketed to other buyers of gas distinct \nfrom power projects. \"That such buyers exist is demonstrated by Enron's own \nMetGas initiative and by Petronet's larger project plans. It is critical that \ncosts of this facility be distributed over its entire capacity and not just \nover the amount sold to the power plant, as is currently the case.

The $570\nmillion was more than Enron previously indicated it was owed, the\npaper said, citing Carol Coale, a Prudential Securities analyst.\n     Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection last\nFriday after incurring more than $9 billion in debt buying\nelectricity at soaring prices and selling it at capped rates.\n     The Bank of New York is the utility's largest unsecured\ncreditor, owed $2.2 billion, the Houston Chronicle said.\n     Four power generation companies asked a bankruptcy judge\nyesterday to excuse them from supply contracts with the utility,\nsaying the agreements could push them to financial ruin.",

Recall that Bob Glynn \nreferenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance \nsheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.  \nNow that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net \nshort, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.

Ray\n\nNGI's Daily Gas Price Index \npublished : April 20, 2001\nCA Governor, Regulators Push on, but Legislature Raises Doubts \nTwo certainties prevailed in California's blighted energy landscape Thursday: \nwholesale power bills are getting bigger and state regulators are trying \nharder to salvage Gov. Gray Davis' deal with Southern California Edison Co. \nBut in the state legislature from which the ultimate solutions must come \nthere was growing skepticism, despite a series of meetings with the governor \nearlier in the week. \nWhile nervousness over the state's electricity bill and the prospect of \ninsufficient power supplies this summer prevailed, Davis met with 25 members \nof California's congressional delegation at a Los Angeles airport hotel to \npress his case for federal actions to resolve the seemingly endless energy \ndilemma. \nThe California Public Utilities Commission has ordered a statewide \ninvestigation of the contractual obligations of the almost 700 small \n(qualifying facility) QF generators toward the utilities, but most of the \nfive-member commission's activity was focused outside its regular business \nmeeting in San Francisco. CPUC President Loretta Lynch offered empathy toward \nEdison's financial plight and renewed pleas for federal regulators to provide \nwholesale price relief. \n\"I have committed that the CPUC will expeditiously review those provisions of \n(Edison's proposed agreement) that require CPUC resolution, and I have taken \nsteps to begin that process,\" Lynch said in a prepared statement released \nWednesday. \"In the meantime, I commit to reviewing on a priority basis any \nand all proposals that promote the financial health of California utilities \nand the interests of its consumers.\" \nDavis and some of the CPUC commissioners have been complaining that the cost \nof the state's daily purchases of wholesale power on the spot market have \nincreased from about $50 million to more than $70 million daily since the \nApril 6 bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but the utility \nchallenged the conclusion that the court filing caused the latest price \nincreases. \n\"While it is understandable, even laudable, that the governor would want to \nfully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not \naccurate,\" said PG&E utility spokesperson John Nelson. He argued that the \nincrease in state payments for power reflect that the state water resources \ndepartment (DWR) now is covering all spot purchases, including the often \ncostly real-time emergency purchases by the state's transmission grid \noperator, Cal-ISO. \nThus, PG&E's spokesperson said the more likely cause of the increased power \nbill lies with recent moves by federal regulators and Cal-ISO, noting that \nthe state grid operator should only sell to \"creditworthy\" entities. These \nmoves were done independent of the PG&E bankruptcy filing, Nelson said. \nAs the daily bill for power goes up, draining the state treasury more \nquickly, pressure mounts for a resolution to the utility financial situation. \nBut the legislature has expressed skepticism toward the governor's proposed \ndeal with Edison. State Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) told news \nmedia Wednesday that bankruptcy might be the best approach for Edison. \nIn adopting the new investigations of QF generators, the CPUC's commissioners \nacknowledged that eventually the issue of back payments to the small \ngenerators needs to be addressed, particularly to a group representing up to \n3,000 MW collectively.",

We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.\n\nNote to all\nThe first prepay is to TXU.  I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.\n\nThe second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.\n\nMy goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.",

At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.\n\nI have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.\n\nI hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKelly McKenney\n\nPhone 020 7547 3486\nFax 020 7545 2327\nEmail: Kelly.McKenney@db.com\n\n\n--\n\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.

Try Geoff Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, Rich Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.  I know that Duke is still hiring, too.  The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.  I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.\n\n     Take care.\n\nDan\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tAnderson, Joel  \nSent:\tMonday, November 19, 2001 3:01 PM\nTo:\tMcCarty, Danny\nSubject:\tFrom Bad to Worse?\n\nEver really want someone to wake you up from a bad dream...\n\nThe good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence.

All of this gas is going to WGR and none of it returns to NNG.  So this was communicated last year when all this was being planned.\n\nThe OBA was not affected with this sell.  The OBA with WGR is one OBA that totalled all points.  They owe us 107,000 dth at the end of last month and we owe them 36,000 dth for fuel usage on the #5 unit at Gomez for the first five months of the year.  All that will be left on WGR's OBA will be Benedum and Midkiff.

I have tried several times to volunteer to help in the recruiting effort, and after trying Valarie Barnes and Traci Warner, Valarie informed me today that the team will not be travelling to LSU this week and indeed \"after careful review, the LSU recruiting effort has been changed from a broad based effort to a Direct Strategy.\"  I know what that means, and frankly I'm quite upset with that decision.  \n\nFirst of all, I don't understand how you go from hiring perhaps your largest contingent from LSU ever, and one semester later decide that a broad recruiting effort is no longer worthy.  I realize the desire to broaden the recruiting effort to include new schools where an Enron presence is a good fit; and I also understand the need to downsize efforts that are no longer feasible.  It just doesn't make sense that LSU falls into the latter category.  The fact is that we are a motivated, hard-working, diverse, and well-rounded group.  We have both the intellectual and the social skills to excel here at Enron, and I think the recruiting team, by making this decision, is missing an opportunity.  \n\nThere are many LSU graduates that hold high positions in this company, and certainly we comprise a large percentage of the Analyst & Associate Program.  By not recruiting in the same manner that you have, you are missing out on the many talents that future LSU business graduates could offer to Enron.  Concentrating your efforts on gathering a few resumes from certain professors or administrators does not allow you to realize our full potential.  On paper, who knows how we stack up against the rest of the field.  But, sit us down and provide us with an opportunity to express our thoughts, experiences, and skills, and I am very confident that you will find in LSU students the Respect, Integrity, COMMUNICATION, and Excellence that defines our company.  This is the manner in which we excel, and indeed that is why I think that I am here.\n\nI realize that I am only one voice, and I have only been here for two months.  But, I take great pride in my school and the fact that Enron took such an interest in LSU and in me. It was my hope that after accepting an offer here, and working for such a great company, that I would be able to pass on how fulfilling this Enron experience is to others at LSU.  With this in mind, it is upsetting to think that I might be the last of the LSU graduates to be recruited in such a manner that was so exciting, so stressful, such a test...and ultimately so rewarding.\n\nBilly, I thank you for your time, and I would certainly welcome the opportunity to speak with you more.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKevin Murray\nAnalyst",

      "content": "Mark, I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little \nmore detail of the analysis.  As you know, we have issues in Canada about \ntaking cash collateral, which issues have been clearly identified and \ncommunicated by Peter previously (see his e-mails of March 20, 2001).  \nHowever, as opposed to cash, it appears clear under our personal property \nregistration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall \nunder the definition of \"instruments\".  Under such legislation, as Peter has \nindicated below, a security interest in \"instruments\" can be perfected by \npossession, thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at \nthe personal property registry, which requirement to register creates the \nperfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral.  \nTherefore, at first blush, it seems that a counterparty providing a certified \ncheque or bank draft to us (in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of \ncredit), which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same \nmanner as we hold L/Cs, might solve our cash collateral concerns and make \nanother credit instrument available to us for use in Canada.\n\nThere are a few concerns, which I think are raised by your questions.  The \nfirst is that, if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash \nand place the cash in an account, we run into the exact same issues as we \nhave with taking cash collateral in the first place.  The personal property \nsecurity legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from \ndealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner \nas original collateral of the same kind (ie. where the proceeds from the bank \ndraft are cash, we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as \nif the original collateral was cash, meaning we have the exact same issues as \nwe currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral).  \nTherefore, we would need to deal with the instrument (bank draft or certified \ncheque) in the same manner as we deal with L/Cs.  That is, we would cash the \ninstrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become \nentitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to \nus from the counterparty.  We would have to actually hold the certified \ncheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose.\n\nThe requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially \nextended period of time raises another concern about how long such an \ninstrument can remain outstanding before it becomes \"stale dated\" and thus \nundrawable.  In other words, it may well be that a bank will only allow such \ninstruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a \nreasonable time of their issuance.  This is one point that would require \nfurther research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as \ncollateral, since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments \na solution for only very short term transactions, if at all.\n\nThe final point I would make is also raised by your second question below.  \nMy understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past \nwith respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque (or the bank \non which the certified cheque is drawn) can stop payment on such a cheque \nafter it has been issued.  I believe that there may have been some recent \nOntario decisions indicating that a cheque, once certified, must be honoured \nupon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn \nrefuses to pay, it will be liable for the amount.  However, we would need to \nlook into this point further, as any risk that a certified cheque can be \nwithdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously \neliminates the benefit of the collateral.  I do not believe that the same \nconcern exists for a bank draft, as I believe it represents a fully funded \nobligation of the bank to pay, which is irrevocable.\n\nIf we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of \ncollateral, I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel \nand obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such \nuse.  Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash \ncollateral, I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these \npoints as well.  Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside \ncounsel to proceed.\n\nThanks\nGreg\n\n\nFrom: Mark Taylor on 04/03/2001 09:05 AM CDT\nTo: Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc: Brent Hendry/NA/Enron@Enron, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris \nGaffney/TOR/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mary \nCook/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russell Diamond/Enron@EnronXGate, Sara \nShackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya \nRohauer/Enron@EnronXGate, William  S Bradford/Enron@EnronXGate \nSubject: Re: Cash Collateral  \n\nSounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions:\nCan we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?  \nIf not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there \n- in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the \ncustomer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.\n\n\n\n\tPeter Keohane\n\t04/02/2001 07:02 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent \nHendry/NA/Enron@Enron, Mary Cook/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nTana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT, Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT, \nTanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT\n\t\t cc: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT, Chris \nGaffney/TOR/ECT@ECT\n\t\t Subject: Cash Collateral\n\nGreg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash \ncollateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an \n\"instrument\" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property \nSecurity Act, and an \"instrument\" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties \nwere to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could \nrely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate \nfurther?  Peter.",

I attach below for \ncompleteness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on \nEnronOnline.  \nThere are two remaining issues which require further thought:-\n\n1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline.  \nFor the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates \nwill be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection the \ninitialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection \n250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do \nhave some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneouse \nchanging of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much \nbetter specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage \nthat many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we \nwill do when FX joins the system.\n\n2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credit \npricing from a due diligence perspective.\n\nElena will be leaving the EnronOnline group at the end of this week and Mark \nDilworth will be our main point of contact in Dave's absence.

Under the terms of the credit product, on the \noccurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the \nReference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or \nits online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed \ncurrency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs \nin a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in \nthe international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of \nour product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely \nchange the analysis below.)\n\nSet out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more \nsignificant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page \"Executive Summary \nof Legal Advice\" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant \nlegal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction \nwith this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on \nissues we raised which are \"all clear\" from a legal perspective, so as to \nkeep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news \ntoo!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below \nwhat action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on \nthe advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely \nto materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a \nrisk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk \nis one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.\n\nA.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000\n\n Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US\n\nB.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be \ndelayed\n\n Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)\n\nC.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)\n\nThe credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and \nrelated products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks \nof a general nature:\n\n(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our \ncounterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the \nproduct and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional \ndocuments before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to \nalmost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in \nall countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general \nlaw (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under \ntheir constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their \nconstitutional documents if they wish to trade).  \n\nThe check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading \nrelationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly \nonerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.\n\n(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure \nthat we are not misusing confidential information about our business \ncounterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur \nboth in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include \nformal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or \nthe credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US \ncounsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include \n(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the \nprocedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that \nconfidential information derived from other areas of our business and which \nwe are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality \nagreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron \nhas an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or \notherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will \nneed its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without \nsuch consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that \nentity for breach of confidence.\n\nD.  Country Specific Issues\n\n(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute \ninsurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the \nproduct unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve \nthis issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in \nCanada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear \nwhich Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.\n\n(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in \nCanada and so Germany should be excluded initially.\n\n(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be \nregarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and \nunenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a \n\"substantial professional effort\" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being \nentered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our \ncounterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade \nby trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should \ntherefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this \nproduct with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic \nbehind its trading this product type.\n\n(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading \nrelationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory \nauthority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being \nunclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty \n(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence \nwill be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However, \nI understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing \nbusiness relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.\n\n(v)  US (New York Law) \n\n(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an \noption (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under \nthe US Commodities Exchange Act. \n\n(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product \nconstitutes a \"security\" under US securities laws (please see attached \nExecutive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of \nsecurities to \"accredited investors\" which will allow us to deal with \ninvestors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our \ncounterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should \nnot impede the business.\n\n(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider \ntrading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security \n(see (b) above) is relatively remote.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------\nPlease feel free to call me on x36566 if you would like to discuss this \nproject further.\n\nBest regards\n\nPaul",

      "content": "Marcello Fontana sent an article from this week's BusinessWeek on an \napparently\nsuccesful policy to promote growth.\n\nECONOMIC VIEWPOINT\n'Bribe' Third World Parents to Keep Their Kids in School\nGARY S. BECKER\n\n        Many well-meaning Americans, including college students and religious\norganizations, have attacked Nike Inc. and other companies accused of\nusing child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations. I agree that\nsomething should be done to save the children from dismal long-term\neconomic prospects. However, effective policies must recognize that the\nfundamental cause of child labor is poverty, not greedy foreign and\ndomestic employers. To combat the effects of poverty, poor mothers\nshould be ''bribed'' to keep their children in school longer.\n\n        Really poor families in Brazil, Mexico, Zaire, India, and many other\nnations put their children to work because their meager earnings help\nprovide basic food and medicine for themselves and younger siblings.\nAlthough parents may recognize that schooling would improve their\nchildren's marketable labor skills later in life, they cannot afford the\n''luxury'' of taking them out of the labor market. In essence, child\nlabor is the result of a conflict between short-term parental economic\ninterests and the long-term interests of the children.\n\n        Adequate economic growth always eliminates child labor even without\nlaws\n\nagainst it. But poor nations needn't wait until they grow richer. There\nare short-term solutions. Many nations have compulsory schooling laws up\nto age 15 or so, but they are often hard to enforce, especially in rural\nareas and poor sections of large cities. Families who want their\nchildren to work simply do not send them to school, or the children have\nvery high absenteeism rates. Officials are reluctant to punish parents\nof working children, perhaps because they recognize that the problem is\nnot selfishness but poverty.\n\n        SHARE THE BURDEN. I propose a better way: Give parents a financial\nincentive to keep their children in school longer. Poor mothers should\nbe paid if schools certify that their children attend classes regularly.\nParents would be strongly motivated to send their children to\nschool--even when the children do not want to go--if these payments were\nnot much below what the children could earn. Most poor parents would\nhappily continue.\n\n        [A few sentences were cut here.  I think they describe Progresa \nprogram\nin Mexico.  I think this program pays a few dozen dollars a month to families\nthat keep kids in school and immunized.]\nMost poor Mexican families earn only about $100 a\nmonth. That large a percentage increase should have a noticeable effect\non their behavior.\n\n        Poor families in less developed nations whose children do go to school\nare likely to withdraw their daughters when they become teenagers. This\ntends to perpetuate economic inequalities, since the children of women\nwho receive little schooling also tend to be badly educated. Progresa\ntries to combat this tendency to favor education of older sons by paying\na little more to families that keep teenage daughters enrolled.\n\n        NARROW THE GAP. This pioneering Mexican approach appears to be highly\nsuccessful. An evaluation prepared for an October economics conference\nin Chile shows that after only a couple of years, Progresa significantly\nraised the schooling of children in very poor Mexican families. It has\nalso narrowed the education gap between girls and boys and reduced the\nlabor force participation of boys.\n\n        Of course, governments need to find the tax revenue to finance\nprograms\nlike Progresa. A good start would be to recognize that Mexico and many\nother less developed nations typically spend disproportionately on\nuniversities and other education of their elites. Redistributing some of\nthis spending to the poor would both reduce inequality and stimulate\nfaster economic growth. Widespread basic education is more effective in\npromoting economic development than generous subsidies to the richer\nstudents who attend universities.\n\n        Child-labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by\nattacking\nnot the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social\npolicies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for\nthe prevalence of child labor there. These governments, and perhaps\ninternational organizations such as the World Bank, should follow\nMexico's example and introduce programs that pay poor mothers to keep\ntheir teenage and younger sons and daughters in school and out of the\nlabor force.\n\n\nDavid I.

They've been a customer of ours since we\nstarted,\" he said of Enron, though he declined to provide further details\nabout Enron's use of TradeSpark.\n\nEnron launched its own electronic trading platform, EnronOnline\n(www.enrononline.com), in late 1999 and used it to execute deals worth $336\nbillion last year. EnronOnline is a bilateral trading system on which Enron\nposts buy and sell prices and is either the buyer or seller in any deals that\ntake place.\n\nWilliams said bilateral and multilateral platforms were completely different\nand that both could coexist in harmony.\n\nEnron, for its part, has said it is willing to use any kind of trading\nplatform that helps its traders to do business.\n\nTradeSpark's founding partners include electronic commerce firm eSpeed Inc.,\nbrokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, energy firms Williams Cos. and TXU Corp. and\nRoyal Dutch/Shell affiliate Coral Energy.\n\nDynegy Inc., which also has its own bilateral trading platform, Dynegydirect\n(dynegydirect.com), has used TradeSpark from its launch and has also announced\nplans to become a partner in the venture at a later date.\n\nDespite some of the big energy names associated with TradeSpark, Williams\nemphasized its neutrality, including anonymity of the prices posted on the\nsystem.\n\nIn January, traders who were not associated with one of TradeSpark's founding\npartners accounted for 58 percent of all trades, up from 48 percent in\nDecember.\n\nWilliams said TradeSpark would expand its product offerings next month to add\nphysical natural gas products alongside the financial gas instruments\ncurrently available.\n\nFinancial electricity instruments will also be added some time this year, he\nsaid, to complement the physical electricity products on offer now.\n\n\n\nFolder Name: Rahil Jafry\nRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 86\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTo review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or \ncontact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com \nor by phone at 800-369-7466.

      "content": "Wednesday February 6, 1:41 pm Eastern Time \nBusinessWeek Online\nDAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?\nDaily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS \nBy Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas \nBack in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. \nThe question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. \nStill, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. \nCULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. \nAlthough many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. \nFor the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. \n``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. \nThat's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' \nStill, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' \nSome industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it. \nGo to www.businessweek.com <http://rd.yahoo.com/finance/editorial/bizwk/*http://www.businessweek.com> to see all of our latest stories.",

Brown:\n\nMy name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the\nThin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in\nSanta Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access \nas\nan option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity \nand\nnatural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing\nprocesses.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and \ncompetitive\nprices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in\nCalifornia.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse \neffect\non our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000\nemployees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original\nUniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics\nCompany in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex \nProducts\nin Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 \ncountries.\nOf all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, \nwhich\nis due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw \nsubstation\nlocated on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  \nUp\nto now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid\n1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and\nare currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas \nmeter\nfor the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity\ncontract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by \nPG&E\nEnergy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the\nimportance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing\noperations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have\nbeen made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the\nprocess of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous\nactivities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct\naccess to energy.\n\n If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will \nhave\nto re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate\nmanufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;\nand San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast\nof the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these\nconsolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct \naccess\nto keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the \"right to choose\"\nis an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and\nviability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access\noption for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.\n\nKenneth D. Pietrelli\nVice President of Corporate Services, TFPG, JDSU\n2789 Northpoint Parkway\nSanta Rosa, CA 95407\nPhone 707 525-7520\nFax 707 525-7846",

Below is the explanation I received from Corp Benefits on the price for your recent activity through Hewitt.  Will get back with you on final resolution to this problem before the end of the week. Hopefully will have an answer for you by  Thursday, no later than Friday. \n\nThanks again for your patience.\n\nResponse:\nIrma,\n\nI've just verified the following information from Hewitt:\n\nOn Tuesday, 11/20/01, Mr. Martin spoke with a rep at Hewitt to roll over his ESOP balance into the Savings Plan.  He made this request at 4:28 p.m.  Since this was after the market close (which was 3:00 p.m.), his transaction did not occur until the 11/21/01 update.  He rolled 1,522.00 shares over to the Savings Plan, at a total value of $7,625.22, which is $5.01 per share.  That value was posted to the Enron Corp. stock fund in the Savings Plan the evening of 11/21/01.  They were in his Savings Plan account as of the morning of 11/22/01 (which was Thanksgiving Day).  \nOn 11/23/01, Mr. Martin transferred his holdings in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund to the Stable Asset fund.  He did this transfer at 2:22 p.m., via the web site.  However, on 11/23/01, the stock exchange closed at 1:00 p.m., instead of the usual 3:00 p.m.  Consequently, the transfer was not effective on Friday, 11/23/01, but occurred on the next business day, which was 11/26/01.  At the time of the transfer, the value in the Stock Fund was $6,113.26, which was equal to $4.01 per share.\n\nThanks again for your patience and cooperation.\n\nIrma Alvarez\nHRSvcConnection\nExt. 3-1543\n\"HRServiceConnection@enron.com\"\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tMartin, Thomas A.  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 27, 2001 12:16 PM\nTo:\tAlvarez, Irma\nSubject:\tESOP rollover into Savings Plan\n\nI left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.\n\nSo where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.\n\nPlease call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.\n\nThanks,\n\nTom",

Bill \nCordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members \nof the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.\n\n 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention \nthat the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit \nourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be \nposted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.\n\n 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be \ndetermined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include \nan estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.\n\n 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a \nshipper exercises its call option.\n\n 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission \npolicy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy \naltogether.\n\n 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages \nfor nonperformance.\n\n 6.  Timeline:\n  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)\n  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service \n  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a \nproducer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)\n  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require \nBoard approval at Enron)\n  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)\n  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)\n\nIf you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to \nget a new draft out by next Friday a.m.",

As a result,\nthere are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay\ntheir basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is\nbankrupt.\n\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million\nworth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the\ncompany's employees to keep buying it.

Since that time, I have had some \nhealth problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on \nAugust 31, 2000. \n\n I did not want to leave Enron's active employment until I had the \nopportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern \nNatural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 \nmonth.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our \ncompany in the late 80's, it has been the most challenging and exciting time \nthat I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt \nof and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on \nAugust 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of \nNorthern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a \nDistrict Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications \nCenter in Omaha.\n\nI have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, \nIowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the \nmany employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am \nfinancially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me \nor my family's future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the \nemployees, and the many other programs like our \"options\", variable pay \n(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee \nsatisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.\n\nThe employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots \nfor Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a \nwonderful job of getting the best of the best.\n\nI hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once \nmore, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRod Williams",

According to the German paper \nHandelsblatt, E.ON's supervisory board reportedly will make a final decision \nin the next week. Powergen, meanwhile, said it is still in talks on a \npossible offer from another company. \"There can be no assurance that these \ndiscussions will result in an offer being made for the company,\" Powergen \nsaid in a statement. The company first announced that it was in talks to be \npurchased on Jan. 16. \n\nAnalysis: The word that E.ON, Europe's second largest power company, would \nbuy a stake in Powergen at a fat 30-percent premium of around 6.90 pounds \nincreased Powergen's British stock price by as much as 7 percent to reach 739 \npence. A combination of the two companies would create a power firm on par \nwith Europe's largest power companies, France's EDF and Italy's Enel. Since \ntalks about a potential acquisition by E.ON surfaced in January, Powergen's \nstock price has climbed 21 percent. In addition, according to Reuters, \nPowergen jumped to the top of the gainers list for the United Kingdom's FTSE \n100 blue chip index. On March 22, Powergen stock reached 739 pence, while the \nFTSE 1000 index was down 2.5 percent at 27-month lows. Powergen also trades \nin the United States on the New York Stock Exchange, where Powergen shares \nopened March 26 at $42.00. \n\nIf the rumors about Powergen's price tag are true, E.ON would end up paying \nmore than nine pounds a share or six billion pounds (U.S. $8.5 billion) for \nthe U.K.-based Powergen, which carries a debt of about 5.2 billion pounds. \nThese projections exceed previous reports from financial analysts who \nsuggested that E.ON would pay no more than eight pounds a share for Powergen. \nE.ON might be feeling increased pressure to finalize a deal with Powergen \nsince other players such as Scottish Power have also expressed interest in \nthe company. With significant capital to spend (Reuters reported up to $50 \nbillion including proposed divestitures), E.ON reportedly believes that \nBritain, where demand is outpacing the rest of Europe, is the best country in \nwhich to begin a rapid expansion strategy. Despite the fact that Powergen had \npreviously acknowledged that it was working on a deal with E.ON, over the \nlast week it has maintained that discussions continue with other companies.  \n\nE.ON, formed as a result of last year's merger between Veba and Viag, \nsupplies Germany and Europe with electricity, heating, natural gas, water and \npetroleum. Germany, which opened 100 percent of its energy market all at once \nin April 1998, has undergone a period of rapid consolidation. As a result, \nthe largest power companies in the country have begun seeking competitive \nopportunities across the Continent (this is a growing trend in Europe as \ncompanies from other countries are following the same competitive strategy). \nE.ON must expand outside of its home country, where analysts have speculated \nthat core profits in its generation business have become unstable. In many \nways, consolidation is a means of survival for E.ON, as Europe continues to \nliberalize and electricity prices fall as a result.  \n\nPowergen\u0001*which generates about 14 percent of the electricity used in England \nand Wales and has electric and gas operations throughout Europe, India, Asia \nand Australia\u0001*is a company that became known for its global expansion \nefforts, especially in the United States. Just last December, Powergen \ncompleted a $3.2 billion acquisition of Louisville, Ky.-based LGOEnergy Corp. \nPowergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the U.S. market, as a result \nof consolidation that had taken place in the United Kingdom. The acquisition \nof LGObecame appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's desire to \nestablish a strong presence in the Midwest market. Altogether, LG&E's two \nutilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in \nassets, which was thought to support any further expansion that Powergen \nmight have had in mind.  \n\nPowergen has a market capitalization of $6.66 billion and P/E ratio of 11.02 \n(according to Yahoo Finance). However, the company has struggled over the \nlast year. Powergen's primary subsidiary, LGOEnergy, saw its profit for 2000 \ndecline by 4 percent to $497 million from $518 million. As the parent \ncompany, Powergen saw its profits decline by 12 percent in 2000, to $518 \nmillion from $590 million, although its revenue increased 11 percent to $6 \nbillion, up from $5.4 billion in 1999. Keep in mind that Powergen's \nacquisition of LGOwas not completed until December 2000, so LG&E's earnings \nwill be reflected fully in its parent's financial report starting this year.  \n\nIf E.ON were to acquire Powergen, it would gain several strategic advantages. \nE.ON would no longer be reliant solely on the German market, where falling \nprices and continued consolidation limit competitive opportunities. In \naddition, the purchase would give E.ON a hold on generating assets in the \nUnited Kingdom, and the comparatively low-cost power production, 3.7 million \ncustomers and various business operations that LGOoffers in the United \nStates.  \n\nAs noted, Powergen has acknowledged that it has received approaches from E.ON \nand other companies. Based on available reports, those \"other companies\" are \nmost likely RWE (Germany's largest power supplier and a rival of E.ON), \nVivendi and Suez Lyonnaise (French mega-utilities) and an unnamed American \npower company (Enron or Southern Energy would be my best guess). However, \nword from its management team is that Powergen is not interested in getting \ntied up (as a purchased entity) in merger or acquisition proceedings at this \ntime as it may be planning additional purchases of its own in the United \nStates.  \n\nOn the other hand, the rationale for Powergen to be sold to a company like \nE.ON is taking shape. British restructuring law has forced large generators \nto sell power stations to reduce any likelihood of market power. As a result, \nPowergen has morphed from a pure U.K. generating company to a broad-based \ncompany engaged in telecommunications, gas, and distribution services. Ed \nWallis, Powergen's CEO, has stated that presently it has become very \ndifficult for Powergen to compete with larger rivals in an enlarged European \nmarket. As noted, Powergen's strategy over the last year has been one of \nfurther expansion in the United States, and the purchase of LGOwas perhaps \nmore expensive than Powergen had planned. In order to make further U.S. \nacquisitions, Powergen needs adequate capital or equity in order to finance \nthe acquisition, something that has become more difficult since its purchase \nof LG&E.  \n\nNevertheless, if the deal takes place it will require regulatory approval in \nthe United States from FERC, the SEC and the Kentucky Public Service \nCommission (among other possible agencies). The climate for U.S. energy \nindustry mergers and acquisitions has become rather turbulent in recent \nweeks. Three high-profile mergers (Entergy / FPL Group, Con Edison / \nNortheast Utilities and Sierra Pacific Resources / Portland General) have all \nencountered difficulties that could derail their pending deals. In addition, \naccording to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal, announced worldwide \nmergers and acquisitions this year totaled $390.4 billion (as of March 21), \nwhich is about one-third of the volume during the same period last year. \nAlso, about 164 merger deals have been withdrawn from the market, compared \nwith 153 deals that were withdrawn for the same period last year, according \nto the WSJ report.  \n\nAnalysts that have been closely watching the potential for an E.ON / Powergen \ndeal say that Powergen's U.S. operations in LGOcould prove to be a major \nstumbling block for the two companies, and that E.ON may find U.S. regulatory \nrequirements to be much more stringent than those in Europe. Specifically, \nthe SEC has strict rules regarding what kinds of companies can own public \nutilities (a category into which LGOfalls) and E.ON's diverse, non-power \noperations may send some red flags to American regulators.  Consequently, \nalthough E.ON appears rather confident that this deal will be completed \nrather soon, Powergen's reported resistance and U.S. regulatory obstacles may \nthwart this yet-to-be-formally-announced partnership.   \n\nAn archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at\nwww.ConsultRCI.com\n\n\n\n\nReach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day.

buy down load at market prices.   \n\n Press Release \n   \nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR \nPR01: 285\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n06/10/2001 \n\n\n\nGOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE \n\nOrder Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans \n\nLOS ANGELES \n\nGovernor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes \nthe California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary, \nemergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large \nbusinesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power \nemergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating \ncustomers. \n\n\"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial,\" Governor \nDavis said. \"Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even \navoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources \nto implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they \nvoluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods.\"\n\nThe Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent \nload curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent \nSystem Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned \nUtilities. \n\nThe DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer \n2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be \ndetermined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the \namount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated \nto be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of \ncustomers who sign up. \n\n \n\n\nExecutive Order D-39-01 \n\n\n\n###\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n\nGOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS ?SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA 95814 ?

As you know, under the current version of the\nISO's Demand Relief Agreement (DRA), costs of the DRP are charged to metered\nDemand including exports, and payments are made to participants from market\nfunds received from Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) on a pay-when-paid basis\npursuant to DRA Section 6.2.  In response to the concerns over backing by a\ncreditworthy party, the ISO approached the California Department of Water\nResources (CDWR/CERS) to provide this financial backing.\n\nCDWR/CERS has concluded that it will not provide backing for the program as\nit is now designed.  Discussions continue with CDWR/CERS and it appears that\nbacking may be provided, albeit for a modified program design.  The ISO will\npublish details of such modified program when they become available.\n\nWith respect to Loads under Demand Relief Agreements that have been signed\nby both the Load aggregator and the ISO, the Load aggregator can choose to\nremain under the existing agreement's terms, which do not include credit\nsupport.  In that case, the ISO will deem the DRA to be in full force and\neffect, and subject to the uncertainty of payment timeframe under the\npay-when-paid provisions.  Alternatively, the ISO will allow Load\naggregators to terminate their Demand Relief Agreements if they provide\nwritten notice to the ISO by June 13, 2001.  If the ISO does not receive\nnotice of termination from the Load aggregator by June 13, the ISO will\ndispatch the Loads in accordance with the terms of the existing DRA.\n\nWith respect to Loads for which DRAs have not been signed by both the ISO\nand the aggregator, the ISO is willing to go forward with the signing of\nDRAs with such parties under the existing terms, which, again, do not\ninclude credit support.  Aggregators wishing to go forward on such terms\nshould contact the ISO as soon as possible.\n\nWhen details of a modified program design by CDWR/CERS become available, the\nISO will permit parties with signed DRAs to \"convert\" to the new program by\nterminating the DRA and signing a new agreement.  Additionally, the ISO will\noffer the same opportunity to participate in the new program to winning\nbidders in the ISO DRP that choose not to sign the existing DRA.  We will\nprovide details regarding the new design and contract terms as soon as they\nare completed.\n\nMike Dozier\nISO Manager of Contracts",

Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current \nMBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater \nBay Area.\n\nDubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded \nHandspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of \nhand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky \nserved as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the \nPalm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted \nnew computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at \nPalm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought \nwith her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from \nApple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot \nin February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. \nShe earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard \nGraduate School of Business Administration.\n\nBeth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community \nAffairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is \nalso a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab \nCorporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address.\n\nSawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in \n1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic \nBrokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took \na sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book \"Coming Up \nfor Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World,\" published by \nHyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an \nMBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.\n\nThroughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a \nvariety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions \nand workshops.  Panels planned for this year's conference include:\n\n    + Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate\n    + Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World\n    + International Business\n    + Wild Women\n\nThis year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, \nJ.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.\n\nFor more information on the WIL conference, please visit \nhttp://www.wilconference.org/2001/index.html.\n----------\nPUBLIC AND WEST COAST SCHOOLS SUFFER IN LATEST FORBES RANKING\nPublic business schools, including the Haas School, lost ground to their \nprivate school rivals in the latest Forbes magazine ranking (Oct. 15) of \nMBA programs that attempts to calculate a \"return on investment\" of \ngraduate management education.\n\nAll of the nation's state-funded business schools dropped out of the Forbes \ntop-ten ranking this year, including the Haas School, UCLA's Anderson \nSchool, and the University of Virginia's Darden School.  Haas placed 15th \nin the new survey, compared with a 4th place finish last year.  Anderson \nwas 12th this year and 5th last year, and Darden was 13th this year and \n10th last year.\n\nThe magazine conducts its ranking by surveying the salaries of MBAs who \ngraduated in 1996.  Forbes said it \"asked alumni for salary information \nfrom the year before they entered business school, the year they graduated \nand 2000.\"  Forbes then  \"compared the total of five years' pay with a \nprojection of what the median student would have earned for those five \nyears without a degree.\"\n\nIn addition, all west coast business schools suffered in this year's \nrankings. In addition to Haas and Anderson, Stanford Business School, which \nwas ranked 3rd last year, fell to 10th place this year.\n\nForbes explained the dramatic changes in this year's rankings by saying, \n\"schools with strong finance programs dominated the top of our rankings,\" \nwhile the \"meltdown among Internet firms\" caused the top California schools \nto fall.\n\nKurt Badenhausen, the editor of the Forbes rankings, further explained in a \nconversation that Haas, Anderson, and Stanford hurt in this year's survey \ndue to the very high pre-MBA salaries of their MBA 1996 graduates.\n\nThe Forbes' ranking:\n1. Harvard\n2. Wharton\n3. Columbia\n4. Dartmouth\n5. Chicago\n6. Yale\n7. Cornell\n8. MIT\n9. Northwestern\n10. Stanford\n11. Duke\n12. UCLA\n13. Virginia\n14. Carnegie Mellon\n15. UC Berkeley\n\nTo view the ranking online, visit \nhttp://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/1015/092.html.\n----------\nFOURTH ANNUAL INVESTMENT BANKING CASE COMPETITION LAUNCHES TODAY\nThe Haas School of Business and Goldman Sachs & Co. are proud to present \nthe fourth annual Investment Banking Case Competition. This undergraduate \ncompetition is a great opportunity for students considering careers in \nbanking, corporate finance, venture capital, consulting, and \nentrepreneurship to get hands-on experience in their area of interest.\n\nSign-ups for this year's competition begin today, October 1, in the Haas \nUndergraduate Program office (S450).  Students are encouraged to form teams \nof four students, though a team may compete with a minimum of three \nindividuals.  To replicate the work environments that graduates will enter \nupon graduation, each team must have at least one member who is not a Haas \nmajor or minor.\n\nEach year this event showcases one of Goldman Sachs' recent high profile \ntransactions to give interested students an opportunity to demonstrate and \nfurther develop their knowledge and skill base.  The case materials will be \navailable Friday, October 5, at noon in the Haas Undergraduate \noffice.  Each team will be expected to present its conclusions through a \nwritten product, similar to the discussion materials often used in \ninvestment banking, consulting, and corporate board meetings (e.g. \nPowerPoint slides).  The presentations are due by 3:00 p.m. on Monday, \nOctober 15, 2001 in the Haas Undergraduate office.\n\nThe review committee, comprised of Haas faculty and Goldman Sachs \nrepresentatives, will review the presentations and select three to four \nteams to participate in the final round.  The finalists will be announced \nand notified by Tuesday, October 23, and final presentations will be held \nthe following Tuesday, October 30 from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in Arthur \nAndersen Auditorium.\n\nEach of the finalist groups will make a 20-minute presentation followed by \nquestions from a panel of judges, which will include company management, \ninvestment bankers, members of the investment community and faculty from \nthe Haas School.

The bulk of this \nproduction is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily \nload is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than \n55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal \ndifferences in load.\n\nTexas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However \nthese states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume \nmore gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the \nregional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and \nmove gas to the areas of greatest demand.\n\nOur goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if \nthe daily production is growing or shrinking.  \n\nVery simplistic, but maybe it helps.\nHunter",

      "content": "Bob,\n\nWith regard to cross commodity netting, I think we need to address the \nconcept of not netting across commodities.  While many commodities do not \nsettle on the same day, and do not present a problem, we need to rethink the \nissue when the settlement day is the same.  I have concerns in two areas:  \nthe first is from a credit perspective, that we are sending out funds the \nsame day we expect to receive them.  Obviously, there is  a risk that we pay \nand the counterpart does not.  Can we quantify when this happens, the \ncounterparts and the dollars involved?  We may just need to put some \nguidelines in place as to when this is acceptable and when a credit approval \nis required.  My second concern is a legal one:  are we compromising our \nposition on termination netting if we have not been practicing settlement \nnetting?  Mark Taylor is the best person to address this issue.  This is more \nlikely to be a problem I would imagine for those transactions where we do not \nseparate the termination and settlement netting concepts within the contract \n(see below).  Once I get legal feedback from Mark, let's sit down and discuss.\n\nThanks,\nTanya\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT on 03/06/2000 01:12 \nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nTanya Rohauer\n03/06/2000 01:11 PM\nTo: Ed Quinn/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Shari Stack/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Frito-Lay\n\nPlease bear in mind that this suggestion is contingent upon legal approval.  \nI do not want our settlement netting position to compromise our termination \nnetting position.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT on 03/06/2000 01:08 \nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nTanya Rohauer\n03/06/2000 01:02 PM\nTo: Ed Quinn/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Shari Stack/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: Frito-Lay  \n\nOne of the remaining open items in the ISDA being negotiated is netting.  I \nhave spoken with Bob Klein and he has indicated that his group can \naccommodate not netting across commodity lines. Due to Pepsico's (credit \nsupport provider) strong credit profile, I am comfortable agreeing to Frito \nLay's request.  However, netting across commodities for termination is not \nnegotiable.  I would suggest we present Frito Lay with the compromise that we \nwill agree to settlement netting within commodity lines only, but retain \ntermination cross commodity netting.  Please call me if you have questions.\n\nThanks,\nTanya",

Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\n\n                  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX),\nsaying the current state of\n                  California's power markets threatens the company with\nbankruptcy, will call Wednesday\n                  for an end to California's four-year experiment with\nderegulation, sources familiar with\n                  the issue told Dow Jones Newswires.\n\n                       John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International,\nis expected to announce that\n                  the company's regulated utility unit, Southern California\nEdison, won't be able to\n                  recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power\npurchases and continue serving\n                  its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market\nstructure is scrapped.\n\n                       In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation,\nEdison will propose to break ground\n                  on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the\npower-generation business\n                  Southern California Edison was required to exit under the\nstate's landmark 1996\n                  deregulation law, the sources said.\n\n                       Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a\nrequest with state regulators to\n                  increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the\nsources said, even though\n                  regulators rejected Edison's request for a rate increase\nof 10% last week.\n\n                       The utility has lined up the support of some state\nlawmakers for the broader\n                  proposal, which would require action by the state\nlegislature, the sources said.\n\n                       Southern California Edison, with 4.2 million\ncustomers, is one of the country's largest\n                  electric utilities. Edison was the first of the state's\nutilities to sign on to the deregulation\n                  effort and, as it says on its Web site, \"played a central\nrole in the restructuring of the\n                  electric industry in California.\"\n\n                       Among the concessions won by utilities in 1996 is the\nrate freeze, which they\n                  demanded to help them recover costs related to\nderegulation but which is now\n                  producing huge losses.\n\n                       Edison's current losses stem from an imbalance\nbetween the soaring prices it must\n                  pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the\nfixed rate at which it can sell\n                  power to its customers.\n\n                       About half of those losses are offset the utility's\nown power sales revenues, which\n                  are accounted for separately and used to pay down\nderegulation-related debt. Rising\n                  power costs have produced a surplus in that account.\nEdison wouldn't reveal the\n                  current size of the surplus, but said previously that the\nCalifornia Power Exchange paid\n                  the utility $1.3 billion over its generating costs for\npower through the end of September,\n                  at a time when its power-purchase losses were $2.4\nbillion.\n\n                       Power-Purchase Losses Mounting\n\n\n\n                       The net losses continue to mount. California's\nwholesale power prices hovered at\n                  record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the\npast two weeks, as colder\n                  weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of\nCalifornia's power supply was\n                  down for maintenance.\n\n                       The price of power for delivery Wednesday in\nCalifornia hit an average of $1,182 a\n                  megawatt-hour Tuesday, up from $250 a megawatt-hour a week\nago, the result of high\n                  demand and a decision by California's wholesale market\noperator to lift its cap on prices.\n\n                       The rate Southern California Edison can charge its\nretail customers, however, is fixed\n                  at $66/MWh.\n\n                       Last week, Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) downgraded its\nratings for Edison\n                  International and PG&E Corp. (PCG), the parent of\nCalifornia's other major utility, Pacific\n                  Gas & Electric, to neutral, saying the utilities may be\nforced to file for bankruptcy if the\n                  state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates.\n\n                       A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MDW) analyst drew the\nsame conclusion Monday,\n                  also cutting his rating to neutral.\n\n                       Edison to this point has kept its power-purchase\nlosses off its earnings statement, in\n                  hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow\nthem to be collected later.\n\n                       The California Public Utilities Commission put the\nhope of such a solution further out\n                  of reach last week, however, when it ruled against rate\nincreases sought by Edison and\n                  PG&E.\n\n                       Credit rating agency Fitch Inc. on Monday lowered its\nratings for Edison\n                  International and Southern California Edison's senior\nunsecured debt to the A-minus\n                  level, citing \"increased liquidity pressure\" and\nuncertainty about the utilities' ability to\n                  recover the costs of their power purchases. The agency\ndowngraded Edison\n                  International, the parent, because half its consolidated\ncash flow is provided by\n                  Southern California Edison.\n\n                       Edison - which sources said plans to remain in the\nretail electricity business - said\n                  late last week that it has secured a $1 billion line of\ncredit and expects to have enough\n                  cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity\nfor the next several months.\n\n                       California paid more than $1 billion for power last\nweek, sources said. Some of that,\n                  however, was paid to Southern California Edison, which\nstill generates about 2,800\n                  megawatts of power in the state.\n\n                       Shares in Edison International have fallen 21% over\nthe past three weeks. They\n                  closed Wednesday at $18.56, down $0.06.\n\n                       -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\n                  mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com(Mark Golden contributed\nto this article.)\n\nKatie Kaplan\nManager of State Policy Affairs\nIndependent Energy Producers Association\n(916) 448-9499\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Katie Kaplan [mailto:kaplan@iepa.com]\nSent: Wednesday, December 13, 2000 10:50 AM\nTo: William Hall; Trond Aschehoug; Tony Wetzel; Susan J Mara; Steve Ponder;\nSteve Iliff; Scott Noll; Roger Pelote; Rob Lamkin; Randy Hickok; Paula Soos;\nMarty McFadden; Lynn Lednicky; Kent Fickett; Ken Hoffman; Jonathan Weisgall;\nJoe Ronan; Joe Greco; Jim Willey; Jeff Dasovich; Jack Pigott; Hap Boyd; Greg\nBlue; Frank DeRosa; Eric Eisenman; Eileen Koch; Ed Tomeo; Duane Nelsen; Dean\nGosselin; Dave Parquet; Curtis Kebler; Curt Hatton; Cody Carter; Carolyn\nBaker; Bob Escalante; Bill Woods; Bill Carlson; Kate Castillo; Pigott Jack;\nTom Ross; Sue Mara; Stephanie-Newell; Richard Hyde; Paula Hall-Collins;\nNorton Kelli; McNally Ray; Marty Wilson; Kristin Vellandi; kent Palmerton;\nKatie Kaplan; Kassandra Gough; Karen Edson; Julee Malinowski-Ball; John\nStout; Jeff Dasovich; Jean Munoz; Jan Smutny-Jones; Bob Weisenmiller; B\nBrown Andy; Andy Brown; Douglas Kerner\nCc: Douglas Kerner; Julee Malinowski-Ball; Karen Edson; Andy Brown; B Brown\nAndy\nSubject: FYI-Edison wants back in the generation business\n\n\n\nEdison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited\nApproval By California Energy Commission\n\n Monday December 11 6:39pm\n Source: Dow Jones\n\n Operation Targeted for August\n\n IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Edison Mission Energy (EME), an\nEdison International company (NYSE: EIX), started construction of its new\n Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited\napproval from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to proceed. The\n power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and\nwill bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which\nis in\n dire need of new power generation.\n\n \"From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find\nmeans to bring new power to the California market,\" said John E. Bryson,\n chairman and CEO of Edison International. \"This CEC approval will help\nensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant\namount\n of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and\nappreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the\n environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this\nimportant project.\"\n\n \"This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing\nfor it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,\"\nsaid\n Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. \"Alternatively, EME will seek to\nenter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &\n Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that\nCalifornia's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power\n resource,\" Fohrer said.\n\n The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will\nconsist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to\n be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking\nfacility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of\n summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental\nand safety standards.\n\n Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project\nonly.\n\n EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II\nexpansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by\nthe\n California legislature.\n\n EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate\nsupply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated\n construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this\nadditional power to California by next summer.\n\n Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,\nconstruction management and operation of global power production facilities.\nAs\n one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy\nowns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in\n 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia,\nIndonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the\nUnited\n Kingdom and the United States.\n\n Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International is a premier international\nelectric power generator, distributor and structured finance provider. With\na\n portfolio of approximately 28,000 megawatts, Edison International is an\nindustry leader in privatized, deregulated and incentive-regulated markets\nand\n power generation. It is the parent company of Edison Mission Energy,\nSouthern California Edison, Edison Capita, Edison Enterprises and Edison\n O&M Services.\n\n /CONTACT: Kevin Kelley of Edison Mission Energy, 626-302-1033, Fax,\n626-302-7827/ 21:35 EST\n\nKatie Kaplan\nManager of State Policy Affairs\nIndependent Energy Producers Association\n(916) 448-9499",

      "content": "<<IPPupdate092001.pdf>> \nGood Morning,\n\nAttached, please find our latest FC note on the Power Generation sector.  \n\nSummary:\n1. IPPs Down 6%; Generation Oriented Utilities Down 2%   On September 17,\n2001, our IPP composite traded off 6.2%, outperforming the NASDAQ (-6.8%),\nbut underperforming the S&P 500 (-4.9%).  Reflecting their more defensive\ncharacteristics, our universe of generation oriented utilities traded off\nonly 1.9%, outperforming all the major market indices.  \n\n2. CSFB Hosting Conference Call on Thursday at 11 AM EDT   This Thursday\n(9/20/01) at 11 AM EDT we will be hosting a conference call featuring Judah\nRose-a power generation expert with ICF Consulting.  The dial-in number is\n877/715-5321.  Among other topics to be discussed, the relationship between\neconomic conditions and power demand growth will be explored in greater\ndetail.  In the near-term, we believe the key analytical challenge for all\nequity investors will be to determine how the prospect of slower economic\ngrowth will impact the outlook for corporate earnings across sectors.  \n\n3. MIR Outperforms Following 2 Key Announcements   MIR issued revised 2001\nEPS guidance of $1.95 versus its prior forecast of $1.90.  Management noted\nthat this revision reflects its continued success in using its trading and\nmarketing operation to optimize the value of its asset base.  Concurrently,\nmanagement announced that its board has approved the repurchase of up to 10\nmillion shares over the next 30 days.  We have revised our EPS estimate\naccordingly in a separate First Call note issued today.  \n\n4. ORN Down on NYC Power Market Concerns; Con Ed Filing Indicates Intact\nFundamentals   Orion Power traded off 14.6% owing to concerns surrounding\nthe potential impact of the WTC tragedy on the New York City power market.\nIn particular investors are questioning the magnitude of lost power demand\nand the potential impact on the supply/demand balance in the region.  In an\n8K filing issued yesterday, Con Ed notes that lost demand approximates 140\nMW-30% below the low end of the initial range of estimates.  In addition, a\nportion of this demand will likely be relocated to other parts of the city.\nOverall, Con Ed's filing gives us greater comfort in our conclusion that the\nfundamentals of the New York City power market remain intact.  \n\nRegards,\n\nNeil Stein   212/325-4217\n\nThis message is for the named person's use only.

Do \nany of you know what the Red Cedar facilities look like?  I.e. how many miles \nof line, any big diameter line, any compression, etc?  Howard must have read \nsome old cases and gotten himself spooked that their facilites aren't \ngathering under the modified primary function test.  I'm not sure why he \nthinks signing a transport contract with us will make their situation any \nworse, but that seems to be his conclusion.  If Steve and Bill can't nudge \nRed Cedar's management into doing the deal, I'd suggest that you both or one \nof you ask Tsuri (sp?) to have his new lawyer call me and Susan after Howard \nleaves, maybe with one of the Kinder Morgan lawyers on the phone also, and \nwe'll try to straighten this out. \n---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 01/12/2000 \n08:37 AM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Susan Scott                           01/11/2000 05:29 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Drew Fossum@ENRON\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Red Cedar\n\nI regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation \nwith Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely \ndeclined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to \nconclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me \nlike whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded \ninterested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at \nFERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very \nleery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their \nidentity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned \nthat after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney \nwill be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  \nMaybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from \nHertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder \nMorgan lawyers.",

Boiling it down, Irwin and his senior leadership team would like to \nmeet with Enron's \"California expert\" to talk about the current and future \nscenarios, in order that Gruma can make more intelligent near-term \ndecisions.  They would like to do this next week if at all possible.\n\nFYI, we have already had several conversations with Steve over the past week \npertaining to our current posture in California, and I've furnished him with \nthe letter we sent to our customers, and the PowerPoint slides prepared for \nmeetings on the subject.  While these were helpful, Gruma's response was \"not \nenough depth...didn't answer all of our questions.\"\n\nSteve gave me a good overview of Gruma's questions and issues which I can \ndiscuss further with you or whomever you designate to meet with Gruma.\n\nLet me know if I can further clarify.\nGeorge",

Hard copies that also include the cover letter, Fed. \nReg. notice, and Appendix for service list are being mailed to all persons on \nFERC's service list in EL00-95-000 (the San Diego complaint proceeding).\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this project; it was truly a group effort.  \nAnd special thanks to the nine companies that agree to join as signatories.\n\nFor those companies that did not join in, we encourage you to intervene ASAP \nin support of the complaint, including the request for an immediate \nsuspension of the chargeback before the next round of chargeback invoices \ncome due (which we believe could be as early as Feb. 15).  Since we are \nasking FERC to suspend the chargeback no later than Feb. 14, your immediate \nintervention would be very helpful.\n\nThanks again.  Ron\n\n - CALPXCOM.DOC",

Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.\n\n- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.\n\n- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application. \n\n- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.\n\n- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.\n\nDave\n\n \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tKitchen, Louise  \nSent:\tThursday, December 27, 2001 4:58 PM\nTo:\tBelden, Tim; Calger, Christopher F.; Presto, Kevin M.; Duran, W.

Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-\n\n+\tInfrastructure\t\tJenny Rub\n+\tDevelopment\t\tJay Webb\n+\tEnronOnline\t\tWebb / Forster\n+\tHR\t\t\tDavid Oxley\n+\tCash Management\tTom Myers\n+\tCredit\t\t\tDebbie Brackett\n\nThe rest will be completed shortly.\n\nWe now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans \"Re-start/Integration\"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.\n\nCustomer Side\t\n+\tCustomers\t\tPhase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)\n\t\t\t\tPhase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)\n\t\t\t\tPhase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)\n+\tAction Plan\t\tPhase  1 Customers\n\t\t\t\tPhase  2 Customers\n\t\t\t\tPhase  3 Customers\n+\tContracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)\n+\tCustomer visit schedule\n\nProduct Side\n+\tList of Products\tPhase 1 - First Week\n\t\t\t\tPhase 2 - First Month\n\t\t\t\tPhase 3 - First Quarter\n\nTarget Number of Transactions\n+\tPhase 1\n+\tPhase 2\n+\tPhase 3\n\nIT transfer \n\nLouise",

This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss.  \n\nThe purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books.

The ancillary service (spin) deals \nneed to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular \ndeal entry summary.

      "content": "California Officials Investigate Electric 'Megawatt Laundering'\nSteve Johnson , San Jose Mercury News, Calif.\n\n( October 31, 2000 )\n\n\n\nOct. 30--While investigating this summer's stunning spike in electricity \nprices, state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon:\n\nOn days when the weather is hot, batches of power generated in California are \nsold to other states. A little later in the day, similar amounts of power are \nsold back to California -- but at much higher prices.\n\nThe question is, is it the same power? If so, that could be \"megawatt \nlaundering\" -- a multi-company conspiracy to evade California's wholesale \nprice cap, which covers power generated in California but not power sold into \nCalifornia from elsewhere.\n\nWorried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of \ndollars, several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering \nduring a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San \nDiego. And earlier this month, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-La Mesa -- who \nhelped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California -- \nformally asked the commission to investigate the practice, which he termed \n\"potentially illegal market coordination.\"\n\nBut an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had \nconcluded that generators had not abused the market. And others say concerns \nabout megawatt laundering are exaggerated.\n\nAmong them is Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy \nProducers Association, a power-firm trade group, and chairman of the \nIndependent System Operator, which oversees most of California's power grid.\n\nWhile acknowledging that such laundering is possible, Smutny-Jones said there \nis no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread.\n\n\"This is one of those things that's turning into an urban legend,\" he said. \n\"I don't want to characterize this as a significant problem.\"\n\nEven some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that \nmost of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing \nmore sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a \ngood deal when they see one.\n\nNonetheless, they see evidence that at least some California-produced power \nis being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. And they \nblame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed \nbecause the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power.\n\nThe Independent System Operator \"invites this type of activity,\" said Frank \nWolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation's market \nsurveillance committee, which has warned of the potential for megawatt \nlaundering in at least two reports this year. \"The thing that makes all these \nproblems go is the fact that the ISO has said, `We'll pay whatever it takes \nto keep the lights on,' and that's screwing consumers big time.\"\n\nIn 1998, when the state's energy markets were deregulated, it was generally \nassumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make \npower less expensive. As a precaution, however, officials at the Independent \nSystem Operator instituted wholesale price caps, which they lowered twice \nthis summer to help keep a lid on costs. On July 1 this year, they reduced \nthe cap from $750 per megawatt per hour to $500, one megawatt being \nsufficient power for 1,000 homes. Then, on Aug. 7, they cut it to $250.\n\nUnfortunately, things haven't worked out the way officials had hoped. \nWholesale prices rose dramatically this year. And while a freeze on retail \nutility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers \nfrom those soaring costs, home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego, \nwhere a similar freeze already has come off.\n\nIn the process, some generators learned that all it takes to get around the \nstate's wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market \nworks. One of the best ways to get top dollar, they learned, was to hold off \nselling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what \nis known as an out-of-market call for energy, which amounts to an emergency \nrequest for electricity.\n\nFrom May through September this year, the overall price of power in the state \naveraged less than $125 per megawatt hour, according to authorities. But over \nthe same period, power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more \nthan $430.\n\nDuring the summer, when energy use is at a maximum, California typically \nimports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. Since power \ngenerated by firms in other states isn't limited by California's price cap, \nthose companies generally are in a better position than California firms to \nmake a killing on out-of-market sales. But by cutting a deal with a \ncollaborator in another state, energy specialists say, California generators \nalso can profit handsomely -- despite the cap.\n\nHere's how:\n\nSay a California generator has 100 megawatts. Instead of selling it in \nCalifornia, where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour \nunder the current cap, it finds a utility, an electricity broker or a \ncorporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state, such as \nArizona. Then -- just before an expected heat wave in California, which is \nlikely to result in an out-of-market call for power here -- it convinces the \nother firm to do a trade.\n\nUnder the deal, the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour \nto the company in Arizona, where there is no price cap, and earns $300 or \nmore per megawatt -- for a total of $300,000. In return, the Arizona firm \nships its 100 megawatts for one hour here. Since that power isn't subject to \nCalifornia's cap, it earns perhaps $400 per megawatt -- for a total of \n$400,000.\n\nPresumably, energy specialists say, the two firms then split the $100,000 \ndifference.\n\nThe potential profit from such deals is considerable. Generators in and out \nof California received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this \nsummer, according to the Independent System Operator. But determining if \nmegawatt laundering is really happening, how often and who might be \nbenefiting, is difficult.\n\nOne California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt \nlaundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of \npower was being sold to another state and then sold back into California \nminutes later. But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that \nclear. While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any \ngiven day, they said, the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the \nsame power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation.\n\nOne big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been \nabused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these \nelectricity transactions private.\n\n\"Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of \nthis laundering don't necessarily have the documents\" to prove it, said Gary \nStern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, one of \nthe state's three main utilities. \"We can only speculate based on things \nwe've heard from others about the practice....It's our hope that's one of the \nthings that's being examined\" by the various federal and state agencies \ninvestigating this summer's extraordinary rise in California power prices.\n\nIndeed, while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially \nlimited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for \nout-of-state power, others argue that it's just as important to eliminate the \nsecrecy surrounding electricity transactions.\n\n\"I'd like to see more information\" made public, said Jim Bushnell, a \nresearcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley, who \nspecializes in analyzing the state's energy markets. \"There are a lot of \nrumors circulating around this,\" he said of megawatt laundering, \"and it \nwould help clarify if this is a serious problem.\"\n\n\n\n-----\n\nTo see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, \ngo to http://www.sjmercury.com",

But a headline deal that would have sent Denver running back Olandis\nGary to the defending Super Bowl champion Ravens nearly came to fruition\nMonday, according to sources within the Baltimore organization.\n\nThe Ravens senior vice president of football operations Ozzie Newsome and\nBroncos general manager Neal Dahlen spoke several times Monday and had in\nplace the framework of a trade that would have sent Gary and a fourth-round\npick in 2002 to the Ravens for reserve defensive tackle Lionel Dalton and\nBaltimore's second-round selection next year.\n\nBut the deal-breaker, according to Ravens sources, was the ever-confusing\nissue of Terrell Davis' health. Ravens officials believe their deal with\nDenver was alive until late in the afternoon, when Broncos head coach Mike\nShanahan became convinced that he could not count on Davis to return to\nhealth this year, even as a backup to starter Mike Anderson.\n\nIt is believed that Davis himself on Monday may have nixed the trade of Gary\nby informing Shanahan that he is uncertain when he will be able to play\nagain. Davis has been out since requiring arthroscopic surgery on his\ntroubled right knee following Denver's season-opening win against the\nGiants.\n\nBaltimore officials said there were some indications coming from the Broncos\nthat Davis may have a new setback in the form of a stress fracture injury,\nsimilar to the one he suffered in his lower left leg last year. Davis was\nexpected to miss six weeks after having surgery to remove debris and repair\na small cartilage tear on Sept. 20.\n\nDavis, who gained 101 yards on 21 carries in the Broncos' opener, missed 24\nof 33 games in 1999-2000 due to leg injuries. The Broncos have described his\nright knee troubles as a degenerative condition, and it was thought that\nShanahan was not counting on Davis as anything other than a fallback option\nthis season behind Anderson and Gary. Anderson tore his right anterior\ncruciate ligament in 1999, then suffered ankle and stress fracture injuries\nin his left leg last year.\n\nThis is the second time in about six months that the Ravens and Broncos have\ngotten close to a deal for a running back, only to have Denver back away in\nthe end. On the first day of the NFL draft in late April, the Broncos were\noffering Anderson to the Ravens in exchange for a second-round pick.\nBaltimore officials said they were agreeable, but that Shanahan changed his\nmind and pulled the offer off the table. Sources say some within the Ravens\norganization feel twice burned at this point in terms of trade talks with\nDenver.\n\nGary, 26, is the youngest running back in the Broncos' stable of three\n1,000-yard rushers. He gained 1,159 yards in just 12 games after replacing\nthe injured Davis in 1999, then saw his 2000 season cut to just one game by\nan ACL injury. He is currently Anderson's backup.\n\nGary's contract with Denver ends after this season. The team has not made\nmuch progress toward an extension. Anderson's deal was extended just before\nthe Broncos' season-opening game.\n\nBaltimore has been involved in off-again, off-again trade talks with Denver\nabout Gary since Aug. 8, when it lost its leading rusher, Jamal Lewis, to a\nseason-ending ACL injury. The Ravens signed veteran Terry Allen to replace\nLewis, and Baltimore has been making do with a combination of Allen and\nsecond-year veteran Jason Brookins.\n\nBaltimore officials say the Broncos instigated the latest round of trade\ncommunication, contacting the Ravens to re-start the Gary talks in recent\ndays. Considered the AFC's top two Super Bowl contenders, both teams are\nunderachieving at 3-3 and coming off consecutive road losses.\n\nDavis has practiced the last two weeks on the Broncos scout team, and\noriginally was expected to return in time for the Nov. 5 game at Oakland.\nBut on Monday, Shanahan held out the possibility that Davis could return a\nweek early, in time for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots.\nDavis' showing in practice this week would make the determination, Shanahan\nsaid.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nAre these guys worth the headache?   I think not.   I'd expect some rebuttal\n/ denial from the Denver side this morning to follow.   Don Banks is well\nrespected and of course, Sports Illustrated is at the top of our game but\nI'm always a little leery of the unnamed \"Raven sources\".   Could be sour\napples on a trade that didn't go right for them.   Or it could be exactly\nhow it is.   Bottom line is this certainly doesn't look good for Davis\nowners.   Let's see what the Broncos say and you can go from there.\n\nOf course, you can always do the smart thing and rid yourselves of any\nDenver RBs.   Not promising you'll win your league but you may come out\nahead with the money you save on Rolaids...\n\nMore today.\n\nJoe\n\nThanks to Footballguy Chris Smith (Smitty on our message boards) for\npointing me to this one.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant Analytics, Inc.

As part of the Industrial Origination Group, Jim Ajello, \nwill continue to lead the origination effort in the metals, refining, and \npetrochemical sector.  Edward Ondarza maintains oversight of origination in \nthe pulp and paper sectors.

We believe that \nthe primary objectives of the CTG have been achieved, and in order to better \nposition the organization for the remainder of 2000 and in response to Ray \nBowen\u0001,s new position, the following changes will be made in the Commercial \nTransactions Group organization.\n\nTransaction Development:  Transaction Development, which was created to \nprovide focused deal execution capability to the Origination groups, will be \nmerged into each respective origination group and report solely to the group \nleaders. \n\nPortfolio Management:  All activities surrounding portfolio investments will \nreport to Jeff Donahue.  Jeff will be responsible for ENA\u0001,s \u0001&capital book\u00018 \nand will have a high level of involvement in existing portfolio investments \nand will work closely with ENA Treasury and the various origination groups to \nassure that new transactions (a) incorporate appropriate risk/return \ncharacteristics, (b) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing \nsignals, and (c) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes \nsyndication of the investment, if applicable, and a specific exit strategy.  \nPortfolio Management includes Restructuring/Special Assets (Randy \nMaffett/Dick Lydecker) and Capital Structuring (Andrea Reed).  Steve Pruett \n(Energy Capital Resources), Chuck Ward (Generation Investments), Don Miller \n(Merchant Generation), and Chris Helfrich (Coal and Industrial) will continue \nto be responsible for day to day asset management for performing investments \nand will report to their respective origination units with a dual report to \nJeff.

Janet will retain \nresponsibility for East Midstream Origination.

He is John Adams boss, so there is a disconnect between the two levels.  In addition to Kent, I spoke to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment, or lack thereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlement statement and use that process.  Going forward however, that is not an effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove your cost structure.\n\nIn speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convinced John Adams, but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that would help.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPortz, David  \nSent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 6:12 PM\nTo:\tNicolay, Christi L.\nCc:\tGilbert-smith, Doug; Baughman, Edward D.; Miller, Jeffrey; Forney, John M.\nSubject:\tErcot Questions OOMC & OOME\n\n\nForwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pay an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  The OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs under Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensation has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Rate value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOMC/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus running the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is located such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QSE to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position should be Reliability Must Run (\"RMR\") and be paid at an adequate premium for their support of the system' reliability.\n\nI noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinitiating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tomorrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with an ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): \"threat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise is not in compliance with these Protocols\".  Though the Protocols Sections 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service products that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered to the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Guides' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Section 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinction between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the position stated by John Forney below. \n\nSorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for your group.\n  -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tForney, John M.  \nSent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 12:27 PM\nTo:\tPortz, David; Gilbert-smith, Doug\nSubject:\tErcot Questions\n\n\n\nDavid,\nI need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:\n\nFrontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.\nThe OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.\n\nThe second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.\n\n   \nHere is the problem:\nthe head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.\nWe explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.\n\nI sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me \"dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money.\"\n\n\n\nHere is my view:\nOOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.\nErcot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.\nIf OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.\nOOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.\nWhy would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a \"breakeven.\"   Ridiculous.\n\nI spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had \"no comment\" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has \"no comment.\"\nBill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.\n\nI had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.\nErcot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   \nWe worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that \" it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME.\"\nThe Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?\n\nFinally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for \"forcing them to OOME our plant.\"\n\nCan I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.\n\nThanks,\n\n\nJForney\n37160",

There is nothing more important to ENA than \nattracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.\n\nEffectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers \nand directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is \nprimarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It \nprovides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only \ndeterminant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance \nmanagement tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:\n a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate \nranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress \ntowards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the \nfurther development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. \nWritten and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;\n b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues \ncategory, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate \ndocumentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure \nperformance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus \non increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is \nalways being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should \nfocus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the \nissues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction \nwith your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better \"fit\" in the \norganization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will \nrequire a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement \nand issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of \naction to rectify performance.\n\nVice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC \ncurrently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above \nwith our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be \ncommunicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.\n\nOther identified action items from the meetings include:\n a) the HR group will put together a \"profile and performance book\" for ENA's \nA&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at \nthe July 19th meeting;\n b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to \ncontinue rotating within ENA;\n c) ENA will be holding an additional \"off-cycle\" A&A super-saturday for \nHouston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;\n and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment \ncandidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a \ntimely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.\n\nPlease communicate to your organization as appropriate.\n\nRegards\nMark and Dave",

      "content": "President Clinton: Taking Action To Help California With High Electricity \nPrices\n\nAugust 23, 2000\n\nPresident Clinton today directed Federal agencies to provide assistance to \nlow income households and small businesses in Southern California. The \nwholesale price of electricity has risen steeply in parts of the country this \nsummer, hitting California\u0001,s low-income households and small businesses \nparticularly hard. California\u0001,s hot weather, its limited generation and \ntransmission capacity, and growing demand have combined to significantly \nincrease the price of electricity. Higher prices have been passed on to \nretail consumers, including low-income households and small businesses, in \ncertain parts of California where the retail price of electricity is \nunregulated because of requirements established by the state\u0001,s electricity \nrestructuring legislation. Earlier this week, the California Public Utilities \nCommission took steps to ease the burden on these consumers by adopting a \nplan to stabilize their electricity bills.\nPRESIDENT CLINTON TODAY ANNOUNCED SEVERAL STEPS TO HELP CALIFORNIA RESPOND TO \nHIGH ELECTRICITY PRICES:\n? Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson today requested that the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission expedite its national investigation of the operation of \nbulk power markets so that state and Federal regulators and policymakers can \nhave the information they need to protect consumers in a timely fashion. \n? President Clinton today directed the Department of Health and Human \nServices to release $2.6 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n(LIHEAP) emergency funds for low-income households in Southern California. \nThis release doubles the funds that the affected region in Southern \nCalifornia currently receives under the LIHEAP program, helping low-income \nCalifornians who have faced substantially higher electricity rates this \nsummer. \n? President Clinton also directed the Small Business Administration to urge \nits lending partners in Southern California to use SBA credit programs, \nparticularly the 7(a) program, and technical assistance to help small \nbusinesses in San Diego and Orange Counties hurt by high electricity prices. \nSBA\u0001,s existing range of loan programs is flexible enough to help businesses \nwhose costs have increased because of high electricity bills. \nPRESIDENT CLINTON ONCE AGAIN CALLED ON CONGRESS TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE \nELECTRICITY RESTRUCTURING LEGISLATION: The President urged Congress to work \nwith the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies to enact \ncomprehensive electricity restructuring legislation, which can promote \ngreater investment in generation and transmission facilities and enhance \nregional planning, reliability and the efficiency of the interstate \ntransmission grid, each of which is needed to ensure the availability of \naffordable and environmentally responsible electricity to power America into \nthe 21st century.\nTODAY\u0001,S ACTION BUILDS ON EFFORTS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS \nMONTH TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS ELECTRICITY NEEDS THIS SUMMER. Earlier this \nmonth, in order to help reduce the risk of power outages as a result of \nelectricity shortages in California, the President directed that managers of \nall Federal buildings in California take steps to reduce consumption of power \nto the maximum extent practicable consistent with the health and welfare of \nemployees, and that Federal agencies coordinate with other state and local \ngovernment agencies to minimize the use of electricity in all government \nbuildings in California. President Clinton also directed earlier this month \nthat all federal agencies take steps to help California maximize available \nelectricity. The Federal government is one of the largest electricity \nconsumers in California representing approximately 2% of all electricity use.",

PG&E created the balancing account for this\npurpose but also stated that they would transfer (on a monthly basis) any\nongoing procurement costs which were not recovered through the TRA (i.e.,\nfrom ongoing revenues) to this new balancing account as well.  It is unclear\nwhat PG&E's purpose is for doing such except  maybe to stop the\nundercollection in the TRA from getting any bigger and hope that they will\nhave a better shot of recovering undercollections in the new balancing\naccount.\n\nAgain let us know if you want us to comment on the advice letter with\nrespect to this issue and the direct access issue mentioned in the previous\ne-mail.

It looks to me like about 1/2 of the gates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caused us to incur numerous DDVC penalties which I don't believe are correct in both Zone BC and Zone D.\n\nIt was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactly the same every day for the last two weeks of the month (I suspect it only varies a little due to the BTU factor).  We were getting penalties on the warm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the load on those days.  Some of the larger gates to look at include Cherokee(2870), Jefferson(2873), Iowa Falls(2876), Britt(2877) Eldora(2878), Mt Vernon(2880), Vinton(2881) & Alto (3574), but there are many others.\n\nI need to look at this more a lot more, including other months, but before I waste more of my time, I'd like to know how and why these were estimated and if you are already working on a correction.  This is the kind of thing that makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing data which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isn't even very good.  The way you are doing it, I don't even understand how you can bill us for DDVC's.  \n\nFrom now on, I think I'd like to get a statement each month of all the estimated data when we get the bill, so we know what to look for. \n\nThanks,\nJeff\n\n\n\nJeff Hicken\nGas Trader\nAlliant-Energy\n608-252-3173",

He reports to Anna Walker, \nthe Director General of Energy at the DTI.  Ian also knows Paul, and I am \nsure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location.  Anyway, \nhere is what he asked:  They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, \nEdward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is \ngetting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his \nfiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there.  The UK DTI will keep \npaying him, so he is effectively free to us.  They want a relevant job/work \nexperience for him.  Ian does not know about his willingness to commute \nduring the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to \nthese kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check.  I think it \nwould be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for \nendearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant \nto the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that \nis something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK.  I would think \nchallenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo \nwriting, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the \npolicy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts?   I can \nget his CV when you need it.  thanks  mcs",

I would like your comments.  What I propose to do is ask that the high pressure shutdowns be reset as close to MAOP as possible, without shutting anything down AT MAOP.  It may take a little adjustment to find out where that point is for each station.  Any problem?\n\nJeff\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tVaughan, Pat  \nSent:\tTuesday, March 05, 2002 8:17 AM\nTo:\tWhippo, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: protecting MAOP\n\nJeff,\nThe regulations are pretty clear.  192.619(a) says  \" . . no person may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure which exceeds the lowest of the following: . . . \" and goes on to talk about design pressure, test pressure and highest operating pressure issues.  There is no leeway.  The regulations provide for the built in problem of buildup pressure in relief devices by giving us up to ten percent above MAOP to achieve full relief capacity, IF we need it due to failure of a pressure control device or system.  Operator error or roll back due to system demand changes are not acceptable justification for exceeding MAOP.\n\nFrom the communications below, it looks like the high pressure shutdowns are being used more as a pressure control device than an overpressure protection device.  If this is to be the case, then the shutdowns must be set at the MAOP, not at some percentage above MAOP.  If this is done, then the relief valves must be sized adequately to prevent operating pressure to exceed the MAOP plus the allowable 10 percent buildup.  I believe that some compressors are relying on shutdown switches as primary OPP since existing relief valves are inadequately sized.  I don't know if this is the case here.\n\nMy thoughts are that if the operating pressure of a pipeline exceeds the MAOP by any amount, then the control systems should be recalibrated to prevent a reoccurrence.  If the control system has unacceptable dead band, then the economics should justify replacing it.  The economics cannot, under any circumstances, justify operating at any pressure that exceeds MAOP.\n\nPat\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tWhippo, Jeff  \nSent:\tMonday, March 04, 2002 6:19 PM\nTo:\tVaughan, Pat\nSubject:\tFW: protecting MAOP\n\nPat, please give me your thoughts on this issue, then I will discuss with Gas Control. \n\nThanks,\nJeff\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPribble, Dan  \nSent:\tMonday, March 04, 2002 8:42 AM\nTo:\tWhippo, Jeff\nSubject:\tRE: Thanks / protecting MAOP\n\nJeff\nI am in agreement with you.  Talk to Pat Vaughan concerning the issue.\nThanks\nDan\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tWhippo, Jeff  \nSent:\tThursday, February 28, 2002 11:27 PM\nTo:\tPribble, Dan\nCc:\tArnie Bailey (E-mail); David Roensch (E-mail); Rick Smith (E-mail)\nSubject:\tThanks / protecting MAOP\n\n\n\nAs you know, we have exceeded the MAOP a couple of times since I have been here.  According to the Advisors, our shutdowns for high discharge at the mainline stations are set at 1020.  This is 12 PSI over MAOP.  These shutdowns should prevent the pressure from ever getting high enough to actually blow a relief valve (at 10% over MAOP). \n\nAlthough we are allowed to set overpressure protection devices to prevent overpressuring by more than 10%,  I don't believe that this gives us permission to operate above MAOP.  My opinion is that we should set the high discharge shutdowns closer to MAOP so that rollbacks due to reduced demand, other conditions resulting in high line pack, or manipulation of pressure to excavate a line, don't result in us exceeding MAOP.   \n\nI need to run this by Pat Vaughn, Gas Control, and probably a few others, but I thought I would start by running this by you.  Do you see any reason not to pursue this?\n\nJeff",

It is a suggested revision to the\nNERC A3A1 time table for the WSCC.  Some basic points are:\n\n*\tElimination of manually setting the WSCC pre-schedule flag.  The\ntable provides rules for e-tag software to automatically set the flag.\n\n*\tThe majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive\nmechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment.  The team\nagreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one (i.e.,\ntags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags\nsubmitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval\nentities would receive compensation for assessing/approving late tags,\netc.).  But, a financial mechanism would likely have to go through a\ncumbersome review/approval process which would be too inflexible for the\nfast paced world of E-Tag and NERC's electronic scheduling.  So, the\nsuggested incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved\nthe closer the submittal time is to the start time.  To do this, we\nconsidered three parameters - the assessment window, deferred denial, and\nthe default composite status.\n\n\t*\tThe assessment window is a period time that the E-Tag\nAuthority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag.\nEach Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond\nwith a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the\nfinal composite status.\n\n\t*\tDeferred denial is when a entity denies a tag, the composite\nstatus does not immediately become Denied, but instead waits until the end\nof the assessment window to set the composite status.  This allows the\ndenying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it, if\nappropriate.\n\n\t*\tThe default composite status is a final stated reached at\nthe end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to\nactively approve or deny a tag.  Currently, tags submitted before a certain\ndeadline will have their final composite status default to Approved.  Tags\nsubmitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status\ndefault to Denied.\n\n\tFor real-time tagging, we cite the hour-ahead business where\nPurchasing-selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour.\n\n\t*\tTags submitted in the first half of the hour-ahead, referred\nto 0 to 30 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are subjected to\ndeferred denial, and will default to Approved/Conditional.\n\n\t*\tTags submitted from 30 to 40 past, will have a 10 minute\nassessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called\ninstant denial), and but will still default to Approved/Conditional.\n\n\t*\tTags submitted in the after 40 past, will have a 5 minute\nassessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called\ninstant denial), and will default to Denied (thus assigned a composite\nstatus of Late).\n\n*\tThe table references specific times in the submittal and assessment\nprocess which should all reference a consistant time zone standard.  The\nteam was divided on the best approach.  Some suggested all times on the\ntable be the prevailing time for the LCA.  This would require each CA to\ninclude in the e-tag registry their time zone.  Some suggested  all times on\nthe table be in Pacific Prevailing Time.  And some suggested that all times\non the table be in Pacific Standard Time.  The conclusion is that a white\npaper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros\nand cons of each suggestion.\n\n*\tThe group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag\nagent's time clock - it should stay with the authority service.\n\n*\tHere's a big one - because the timing table allows for later\nsubmittal times, the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of\nthe WSCC standard ramp (i.e., currently starts at 10 minutes before the\nhour).  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the\nfeasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration\nstraddling the hour to 10 minute duration stranddling the hour (i.e., starts\nat 0:55 and ends at 0:05).  Such a change would aglign the WSCC with the\nEastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag\nsubmittals.\n\nI",

The unemployment rate climbed to its highest level in \nalmost five years as the impact of the terrorist attacks has \nserved to prolong the economic malaise. In equities news, the \nJustice Department has officially agreed to a settlement in the \nanti-trust case against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,62,f1).\n\nThe U.S. Justice department announced that it had agreed to a \nsettlement with Microsoft, which will be presented to the \nFederal Judge overseeing the case today. The accord will impose \na \"broad range\" of restrictions for the company lasting for at \nleast five years. The 18 states involved in the antitrust case \nhave not agreed to the provisions of the settlement and are \nexpected to ask Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly for an extension of \ntime to review the terms.\n\nBEA Systems (BEAS,11.70,f1) reduced its 3Q and 4Q guidance after \nthe bell last night and said that it would be forced to cut up \nto 10% of its staff, owing to the sluggish economy. The \napplication server software maker said it expects 3Q earnings, \nexcluding charges and items, of $0.05-$0.06 per share, below the \nFirst Call $0.08 per share consensus, amid lower than expected \nrevenue. BEAS is forecasting 4Q revenue growth in the low single \ndigits and earnings of $0.06-$0.07 per share, below the Street's \nmean $0.09 per share estimate.\n\nHealth insurance giant Cigna Corp. (CI,72) posted 3Q profits of \n$1.66 per share, excluding a $33 million gain from the sale of a \nreinsurance business, well ahead of the First Call consensus \nestimate of $1.58 per share. However, the company's medical risk \nloss ratio rose by 1.6%, suggesting potential profit margin \nerosion going forward. Medical risk loss ratio is a key measure \nof medical cost coverage ability.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY \n\nTreasuries were mixed after swinging wildly following the \nrelease of this morning's weaker-than-expected employment \nreport. According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate \nrose to 5.4% in October from September's 4.9% level. Analysts \nper Dow Jones Newswires were looking for a rate of 5.2%. \nNon-farm payrolls declined by 415,000, the largest one-month \ndrop since 1980, after September's downward revision to a \n213,000 decline from the previously reported 199,000 drop. \nAverage hourly earnings rose to $14.47 from the prior month's \n$14.45. The services-producing sector cut 241,000 jobs, while \nthe manufacturing industry eliminated 142,000 positions. The \nbleak employment situation, reflecting the economic impact of \nthe terrorist attacks, leaves the door open for continued \naggressive monetary easing.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORLD MARKETS \n\nTechnology stocks paced the advance in Europe on the heels of a \nSemiconductor Industry Association report yesterday. The report \nindicates that September was the third-consecutive month of a \ndecelerating demand slowdown. However, the gains were muted \nsomewhat by the release of a worse-than-expected German \nPurchasing Managers' Index report. The business index for \nOctober fell to 42.0 from September's 45.1, its \nseventh-consecutive month of contraction. UK insurance giant \nPrudential PLC (PUK,21) said that it will cut 2,100 jobs to \nlower expenses. Consumer staples giant Unilever (UL,29) reported \nbetter-than-expected 3Q operating profits and stuck to its \nguidance for at least 10% growth in fiscal year earnings. The \neuro was slightly higher against the U.S. dollar. The Bloomberg \nEuropean 500 index was up 0.43% as of 8:53 a.m. EST.\n\nAsian stocks were mixed but mostly higher on strength in the \nbrokerage and technology sectors. Results were mixed as \nsemiconductor stocks got a big boost on the favorable SIA \nreport, but electronic components maker TDK Corp. (TDK,47) \nposted weak fiscal first-half profits, lowered full-year \nguidance and warned of more job cuts amid waning demand. \nAlthough a Liberal Democratic Party panel is pushing for \ninflation targets in Japan, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami \ncalled the idea \"absurd,\" despite rhetoric from the BOJ Finance \nMinister aimed at mitigating deflationary pressures. The yen was \nslightly higher against the dollar.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFUTURES WATCH \n\nIn the December Globex futures contract as of 8:53 a.m. EST, the \nS&P 500 index was unchanged (1 point below fair value) while the \nNasdaq 100 index was also unchanged (7 points below fair value). \nThe December DJIA futures contract was down 15 points (27 points \nbelow fair value) and the December crude oil futures traded on \nthe NYMEX were down $0.12 at $20.27/barrel.\n\nWilliam Johnson, Market Analyst\n\n================================================================\n\nLOGIN to access your account:\n\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo unsubscribe or modify your Email Alert customization options,\nlog in using the link below or copy and paste it into your \nbrowser's address window:\n\nhttps://investing.schwab.com/trading/start?SANC=EAMyAlerts\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice: All email sent to or from the Charles Schwab corporate \nemail system may be retained, monitored and/or reviewed \nby Schwab personnel.

Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction\n> of a legislative package promoting renewable energy, distributed\n> generation and co-generation, it quickly turned to how the Governor will\n> deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities.  The Governor said\n> that it has \"become increasingly obvious\" to him that the best solution to\n> the utilities' financial problems is the \"acquisition of transmission\n> lines.\"  He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities \"most\n> significant asset\" and would be something the public would be able to get\n> value from \"in perpetuity.\"  He said the arrangement will likely be a\n> \"lease\" of the utilities' lines, with the companies continuing to maintain\n> them, \"to capture [the utilities'] expertise.\"  Details of this plan will\n> be announced on Friday, the Governor said.  The time and place for this\n> announcement have yet to be released.\n> \n> The Governor later said he felt the utilities' parent/holding companies\n> should \"be part of the solution\" so there would be \"shared pain\" in\n> reaching a solution.\n> \n> The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines\n> will involve the sale of revenue bonds, but he \"didn't have enough wisdom\"\n> when asked about it to give a firm answer.  He said he believed he would\n> have that wisdom on Friday. \n> \n> The Governor also commented on his plan to police and/or fine business\n> establishments that keep their lights on after business hours.  He said he\n> would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar. 15, a specific program\n> to reduce by 50-70% the amount of energy used by retailers after-hours.\n> \n> The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote\n> renewable energy, distributed generation and co-generation through\n> incentives, rebates and tax credits.  \n> \n> The package contains:\n> 1.) \"Rebate Increase Bill\": \"Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the\n> Renewable Resource Trust Fund\" = $50 million to increase rebates for\n> renewable distributed generation systems smaller than 10 kilowatts (this\n> money will come from the General Fund)\n> \n> 2.) Tax Credit Bill: SB 17X (Brulte): A 50% tax credit for the purchase\n> and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than\n> 10 kilowatts and up to 200 kilowatts for large facilities such as\n> apartment complexes and businesses. \n> \n> 3.) Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program: AB 53X (Reyes): $50 million\n> for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems,\n> distributed generation and co-generation facilities. \n> \n> 4.)Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities: This proposal will\n> provide $20 million to achieve 40 MW of reduced peak load through\n> retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal\n> water districts to improve environmental performance.  This involves\n> retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural\n> gas technology. \n> \n> 5.)Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less\n> than 1 MW from Standby Charges: Elimination of the standby charges paid by\n> distributed generation end-use customers to the Investor Owned Utilities.\n> This includes small co-generation facilities and only applies to units\n> that generate less than one megawatt. \n> \n> ***********************************\n> \n> Please find the text of the Governor's press release for this news\n> conference below:\n> \n> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n> 02/14/2001 2:00 pm \n> \n> GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY,\n> DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND CO-GENERATION \n> \n> SACRAMENTO \n> \n> Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide\n> incentives to power up more renewable energy, distributed generation and\n> co-generation to help meet California's energy challenge.\n> \n> \"By investing in renewable energy sources, clean distributed generation\n> and co-generation, we can increase our energy supply without taking power\n> away from the grid,\" Governor Davis said. \"My generation plan contains the\n> most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation.\"\n> \n> Distributed generation and co-generation are powerful tools for meeting\n> California's power needs. These types of facilities reduce demand on the\n> state power grid. They also provide energy independence from the\n> Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market; advanced\n> technology that creates jobs as well as power; and reliable energy sources\n> that respect the environment.\n> \n> Governor Davis' legislative package for distributed generation,\n> co-generation and renewable energy includes:\n> \n> \n> 1.   $50 million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation\n> systems smaller than ten kilowatts. \n> 2.   A 50% tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable\n> distributed generation systems larger than 10 kilowatts and up to 200\n> kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses.\n> This will be carried in SB 17x by Senator Jim Brulte (R-Cucamonga). \n> 3.   $50 million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable\n> power systems, distributed generation and co-generation facilities. This\n> will be carried in AB 53x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno). \n> 4.   $20 million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by\n> municipal water districts to improve environmental performance. This\n> involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean\n> natural gas technology. \n> 5.   Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation\n> end-use customers to the Investor Owned Utilities. This includes small\n> co-generation facilities and only applies to units that generate less than\n> one megawatt. \n> \n> \n> The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass\n> legislation to implement these proposals.\n> \n> Co-generation is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or\n> steam, usually on an industrial site. Typically, the electricity is sold\n> to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process\n> \n> Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to\n> generating electricity. Generally, the electricity is generated on the\n> site where it is being used. It can include renewables (such as solar or\n> wind power), fuel cells, and micro-generators.\n> \n> Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center\n> Co-Generation Plant in Sacramento. The plant supplies not only all of the\n> electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling, for the UC Davis\n> Medical Center. It produces 26 MW of power. Since the Medical Center needs\n> less than half of that, the excess power is sold back to the ISO, which\n> pays the Center's utility bills.\n> \n> \"The UC Davis Medical Center Co-Generation Plant is a self-sufficient\n> facility,\" Governor Davis added. \"It is an efficient facility. It is a\n> clean facility. And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of\n> to meet our peak energy demands.\"\n> \n> Governor Davis' energy plan relies on three elements: stabilization,\n> conservation and generation. The Governor is working with legislative\n> leadership on a stabilization plan for the State's Investor Owned\n> Utilities. Over the last several weeks, Governor Davis unveiled an\n> aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and\n> keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced\n> and sold in California. \n> \n> \n> ###\n> \n>",

Our CA attorneys prepared a summary \nof the CPUC action, which is provided below.\n\nENRON ACTIONS:  Most of the calls we've received from EES have concerned the \nCPUC's proposed requirement that retail customers be forced to retain their \ninterruptible contracts for their full five-year terms.  We have learned that \nEnron has customers or potential customers on both sides of this issue -- we \nhave customers who want to get out of the contracts and customers who want to \nstay on the programs.  After discussion with Doug Condon and others, we have \ndecided to stand on the sidelines and not take a position on that issue.  \nPlease feel free to call one of us with comments or questions. Sue Mara (415) \n782-7802, Jeff Dasovich -7822, Mona Petrochko -7821.\n\nPREPARED SUMMARY:  Here is a preview of the Commission's latest actions\nin response to the \"crisis\" in the California electric market.\n\nIn short, the Commission has instituted an Investigation into operation of\nthe interruptible load programs of the three UDCs, and the effect of these\nprograms on energy prices, other demand responsiveness programs, and the\nreliability of the electric system.\n\nThe item which has gotten the most \"press\" from the OII so far is the\nproposed temporary suspension of the tariff provisions of the three UDCs\nthat allow customers to opt out of their interruptible program contracts\nduring the 30 day window commencing November 1st.  The Commission is using\nits authority under PUC Section 743 ( which gives the Commission specific\nauthority to amend interruptible contracts between the UDCs and qualified\nheavy industrials) to propose such suspension.  Although parties are allowed\nto comment on the suspension by this Thursday (the 12th), the Commission\ndoes have the apparent authority to effect the change and it will most\nlikely  proceed with the suspension.\n\nApart from the enforced extension of the interruptible contracts, however,\nthe OII potentially could have broader ramifications.  The intent of the OII\nis to examine all interruptible, curtailable, and demand responsiveness\nprograms being currently offered and/or  proposed in California, and to\ndetermine how these programs can best be structured and/or reformulated to\nserve the Commission's goal of ensuring reliable and reasonably priced\nelectric service within California (especially for the summer of 2001).  It\nis hard to tell exactly what the Commission has in mind.  However, it is\npossible that such reformulation of curtailable/demand responsiveness\nprograms could interfere with Enron's ability to make interruptible/ demand\nresponsive deals with customers.\n\nMoreover, the OII is not merely looking at larger customers. It states as\none of the purposes of the rulemaking the identification of if and how\nsmaller customers can participate in curtailable programs.  Specifically,\nthe OII states that \"we need to examine the ability of smaller customers to\nparticipate; the development of rate design and incentive polices of such\nparticipation; a cost/benefit analysis of such programs; and the marketing\nof any such programs.\"",

Barbara's \ncharcterization of \"irrelevant\" arguably makes sense from a customer's \nperspective, but it's very relevant to us, though I didn't give Barbara the \ndetails of why it's so important for us---just explained that some of our \ncustomers, given their contracts with us, would get hurt.  \n\nSeems that the important take away is that 1) they are actively negotiating \nthe \"end\" of the rate freeze, 2) customers get hurt from a retroactive \"end\" \nand 3) one \"freeze\" will the replaced with another, that is, prices will \ncontinue to be capped going forward (despite the \"end\" of the rate freeze).  \n\nSeems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze \"ends\" next month, \nor next year, which is something that we're going to want to follow very \nclosely.

Per your request, I talked to Jeff yesterday early evening.\nI had been in a meeting with Keeley, Wright, et al after the hearing.\nJeff's proposal was not entirely clear to me, but it seemed to focus on\nspecifying an end date for the rate freeze in the Hertzberg bill.  I\nnoted that the focus of the Friday hearing and the subsequent meeting\nwas on how much of the short fall the utilities should be able to\nrecover and agreed that we would probably go from one freeze to\nanother.  Therefore the date of the end of the original freeze is\nrapidly becoming irrelevant unless it is used to create a back way into\nthe first issue.  This does not seem very likely right now.  Who knows\nhow this will evolve, of course, but there is a sense of urgency, at\nleast in the Assembly.\n\nTake care, Barbara",

      "content": "PennFuture's E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication  concerning \nthe current themes and trends in the energy market.\n?\nPennFuture, which has offices in Harrisburg, Philadelphia and  Pittsburgh, is \na statewide public interest membership organization, which  advances policies \nto protect and improve the state\u0001,s environment and economy.  PennFuture\u0001,s \nactivities include litigating cases before regulatory bodies and in  local, \nstate and federal courts, advocating and advancing legislative action on  a \nstate and federal level, public education and assisting citizens in public  \nadvocacy. \n\n\nSeptember 27, 2000\nVol. 2, No. 19\n?\nThe Answer, My Friend\u0001(\n?\nHow do we develop a cleaner, sustainable electric industry? The answer is  \nliterally blowing in the wind. In fact, about 100 MW of new wind generation \nwill  be operating in Pennsylvania by 2001 \u0001* a small portion of the \nCommonwealth\u0001,s  total wind resource, which is enough to produce about 13 \nbillion kWh or 10% of  Pennsylvania\u0001,s total electricity consumption. But \nchallenges must be overcome to  keep this crop from fading into thin air. \n?\nWhy are obstacles being overcome to make wind power part of Pennsylvania\u0001,s  \nenergy future? Customers want clean energy, and wind is readily available,  \nespecially in the northeastern, central and southwestern areas of our state.  \nWhile some other states have better wind resources, Pennsylvania has plenty \nof  Class 3 wind resources and a good bit of Class 4, much of which is \nlocated in  rural communities. Ironically, sufficient wind resources are also \noften found in  formerly important coal centers that were decimated when \nmachines replaced human  labor and mines were emptied of marketable coal. It \ncould offer these  communities a sustainable economic future, as the wind is \nnever mined out.\n?\nJust one year ago, when E-cubed discussed reasons to \u0001&Go With the  Wind,\u00018 \n(Vol. I, No. 9, 9/14/99) no commercial wind farms were operating in  \nPennsylvania, but our state had, and still has, the most vibrant customer \nchoice  program in America. Today, there are already two new, clean renewable \nwind  generation facilities that were built in direct response to consumer \ndemand.  \n?\nThe 10.4 MW Green Mountain Farm in Garrett, Somerset County, can produce  \nabout 25,000 MWh of electricity, enough to serve about 2,500 households each  \nyear.? The 130 kW Pennsylvania Wind Energy Project in Hazleton, Luzerne  \nCounty, can produce about 200,000 kWh of electricity and will double in size  \nthis fall. But even when additional 130kW turbines are installed, Community  \nEnergy\u0001,s \u0001&wind block\u00018 sales will have served only about half of the small  \ncommercial customer load that subscribed to its limited \u0001&pilot\u00018 marketing  \nprogram. These two operating wind farms avoid 123 tons of S02, 12,000? tons \nof CO2, and 4,700 tons of  NOx.\n?\nTwo larger wind farms are expected to be operating next year. Atlantic  \nRenewable and International Wind are developing a 15.6 MW Mill Run wind farm \nin  Fayette County, and National Wind Power is developing a facility near \nScranton,  Lackawanna County, which will produce at least 15 MW initially. \nAlthough not all  will be completed by the end of 2001, seven other projects \nby five active wind  developers are scheduled to provide an additional 110 MW \nof new wind generation  in Pennsylvania during and after 2001. The wind \nindustry expects that about 200  MW could be built in Pennsylvania within two \nto three years. If 100 MW of  additional wind generation replaced system \npower, Pennsylvania would avoid 1,250  tons of SO2, 123,000? tons of CO2  and \n48,000?tons of NOx.\n?\nThese new wind developments are fueled not just by wind, but by investment  \ndollars and consumer demand as well. The Pennsylvania Wind Development \nProgram  recently announced the availability of wind energy production \nincentives, for  new facilities that become operational by the end of 2001, \nof up to 1.5  cents/kwh for five years. The program, operated for the \nSustainable Development  Fund by The Reinvestment Fund, will receive $12 \nmillion from settlement of the  PECO/Unicom merger, which is expected to \nbecome final in November. \n?\nConstruction by the end of 2001 is also important because the federal  \nProduction Tax Credit for new wind development expires at that time, and it \nis  unclear if it will be renewed. \n?\nProduction incentives are crucial for wind power, especially in  \nPennsylvania, where wind resources tend to peak in both the winter and \nduring  the late evening hours when the demand for electricity is low. In the \ncurrent  market, the estimated average energy value from wind power is only \nabout 1.5 to  2.0 cents/kWh. The \u0001&green attribute\u00018 can fetch about another \n2.0 cents/kwh for  total market revenues of around 4.0 cents per \nkilowatt-hour.\n?\nCalifornia wind production, on the other hand, generally peaks in the  \nafternoon when the demand for electricity is high, resulting in average \nelectric  sales value of approximately 3.0 cents/kWh. \n?\nBy comparison, wind costs about 5.0 cents per kilowatt-hour to produce in  \nPennsylvania.? The cost is on the way down, although it could be some time  \nbefore it dips as low as the 3.0 cents and less mark in those areas of the  \ncountry with the very best wind resources. \n?\nHowever, total generation costs of Pennsylvania wind compare favorably to  \nall-in nuclear generation costs, such as Limerick\u0001,s 8.5 cents/kwh and  \nSusquehanna's near 7.0 cent all-in cost, but still cost about 33% more than  \ntotal costs of a new fossil fuel plant. Of course, existing nuclear plants \ndo  not have to recover the all-in production costs through the market, \nbecause  those costs are subsidized by stranded costs payments. The $12 \nmillion of  funding in the Pennsylvania Wind Development Program is a drop in \nthe bucket  compared to the billions of dollars that subsidize nuclear power \nplants. \n?\nAnother challenge to new wind power is that the exploding demand for wind  \nturbines throughout the world and the rush to build American wind farms by  \nDecember 2001 are stressing the capacity of turbine manufacturers to meet  \norders. Only five qualified wind manufacturers do business in the U.S. Of \nthe  five, two are taking no new orders through 2001, while two others have \nlimited  capacity remaining for additional orders. The leading manufacturers \nare  unfortunately not American but European \u0001* many are just beginning to \nhave enough  business in the U.S., and Pennsylvania in particular, to \nsupport? necessary  sales and operating support. \n?\nIf turbines are available to harvest the wind, Pennsylvania\u0001,s wind resource  \nis sufficient for commercial development, but does not generate as much or \nas  valuable electricity as in other states. For example, some states may \nhave Class  5 wind that blows strong and steady during peak electric load \ntimes. The best  sites in Pennsylvania are only Class 4, and the wind often \nblows intermittently.  In addition to the lower average price for the \nelectricity generated at off-peak  times, the resource at a site is crucial \nto project finances and requires  detailed assessment. A site generally must \nbe \u0001&metered\u00018 for a full year before  investors will make a commitment to a \nproject. \n?\nAlthough there are no technical barriers to interconnection of wind  \ngeneration to the grids in Pennsylvania, the intermittent nature of wind \nalso  makes interconnection with a system based on predictable generation \nmore  difficult and less economic. For example, some operating systems still \nhave  rules that impose substantial penalties for inaccurate scheduling of \ngeneration,  even though the real time balancing markets required under FERC \nOrder 2000  should eliminate the need for these penalties. The intermittent \nnature of wind  makes such rules especially burdensome for wind projects. \n?\nOn the bright side, some of the early problems with wind generation are  \nsuccessfully being overcome. New wind turbines now purr along quietly \ncompared  to older technologies. New turbines also turn quite slowly and \ndevelopers are  sensitive to the rights of birds to fly. While wind turbines \nwere once  considered eyesores, the sleek postmodern look is increasingly \nfound attractive,  especially in comparison to transmission lines, cell \ntowers, or the strip mining  that often occurred on the same land upon which \nthe turbines are now being  built. \n?\nCommunities also are welcoming wind projects, not just because problems  \nrelated to noise, birds, or view sheds can be minimized, but as important \nrural  economic development and supplementary income to farmers. A farmer can \nreceive  rental income of about $2,700 per year per turbine erected on a tiny \nportion of  farmland without significant interference to farming operations. \nA 15-turbine  wind farm could add $40,000 in annual income to a hard-pressed \nsmall  farmer.\n?\nA rural township can also expect a boost in its tax base.  For example, when \nthe wind farm was built, the Garrett tax base increased about  100%. And, \nlocal construction contracts comprise about 20% of the cost of a new  wind \ndevelopment, so that a $15 million wind farm generates about $3 million.  \nConservation Consultants\u0001, Wind Farm USA Project works in farming areas with \nthe  best wind development potential to help rural communities understand \nthe  economic as well as environmental benefits of new wind development. \n?\nPennsylvania will never have the best wind resources, but the remaining  \nchallenges facing its wind industry can readily be overcome. The federal  \nProduction Tax Credit should be extended for several years, the Pennsylvania  \nWind Development Program should be expanded, and system operators should \ncorrect  their rules in order to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the \ndevelopment of our  burgeoning wind industry. \n?\nUltimately, consumer demand may resolve these problems. If consumer demand  \nis strong enough, the manufacturers, markets, systems operators and others \nwill  find doing business in Pennsylvania wind to be just another day at the \noffice,  or should we say, down on the farm.\n\nE-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications.  \nAuthors are available for print or broadcast. \nSupport E-cubed by becoming a  member of PennFuture \u0001* visit our secure online \nmembership page at www.pennfuture.org by clicking on \u0001&Support  Our Work.\u00018\n - Vol2No19_92700.doc",

At least the turmoil in the markets flushed away some really bad ideas.\nLee Clifford\n\n12/24/2001\nFortune Magazine \nTime Inc. \n155\n(Copyright 2001) \n\nFor an instant take on how 2001 treated investors, all you had to do was flick on your TV. Gone were the frenetic performance-touting spots of years past. In their place: dour Schwab ads in which founder Charles admonishes a mock town meeting of gray-clad investors, \"You have to take the ups with the downs.\" \nSigns of new stock market sobriety were everywhere this year: CNBC viewership tumbled, ten rate cuts by Greenspan & Co. still couldn't stave off a recession, and highly paid analysts were not only stripped of celebrity status but also sued by investors (Mary Meeker) or humbled into accepting buyout packages (Henry Blodget). By early December the Nasdaq was down 17% for the year, the Dow had fallen 6%, and the S&P was off by 12%.\nThen again, \"there are so many scenarios you could have written that would have been so much worse,\" points out Roy Weitz, editor of FundAlarm.com. In fact, since the unprecedented four-day market shutdown and subsequent slide after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow has rebounded 13%. Given the year we've had--what with events like the Enron implosion, the Bass brothers' massive margin call, and the uproar over a giant diaphragm in Denver (read on for an explanation)- -it's entirely possible that the last few weeks of 2001 will bring even more surprises. Let's hope at least some of them are happy ones. \nS&P 500 standout: J.C. Penney led the pack for most of 2001 but late in the year was eclipsed by Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for Microsoft's Xbox, among other things. The company got an extra boost when it inherited Enron's spot on the S&P 500 and index fund managers raced to buy the stock. Gain for the year: 225%. \nS&P 500 laggard: Lending can be a risky business, especially if your niche is hawking credit cards to people with spotty credit histories just as the economy heads into a tailspin. Such was the fate of Providian Financial, which lost a full 95% of its value amid a spectacular run of credit card defaults. \nBest way to cash out: Selling your stake in a company you built is never easy, but if you're Tom Bailey, the company is Janus, and you have a \"look back\" provision in your contract allowing you to unload your shares at the 2000 price, which reaps $603 million--well, it tugs at the heartstrings a little less. \nWorst way to cash out: Margin calls are always ugly, but rarely quite as big--or as publicized--as the late-September fiasco in which longtime Disney shareholders Sid and Lee Bass (and their dad, Perry) were forced to sell 135 million shares for around $2 billion. It gets worse: Their shares fetched only $15 each in a private deal; Disney stock now trades for $22. \nBest fund: In a year marked by--at best--middling performances, the small-cap Schroder Ultra gained a stellar 62% by keeping lots of cash on hand (around 40%), using put options, and shorting stocks (like a hedge fund). The only drawback? The fund is closed to new investors. \nBest reason to manage your own money: Fund manager James McCall of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty. Merrill waged a bitter legal battle to lure the then-hot momentum manager from Pilgrim Baxter two years ago. It's no doubt regretting that decision now: McCall got his walking papers in November after the Focus fund, which held tech, telecom, and Enron, lost 70%. \nWorst reason to manage your own money: You may be a step ahead of McCall, but hanging on to your day job is probably a good idea, judging from the performance of so-called market-participation funds. At the IPS iFund, where shareholders nominate stock picks on a Website, collective wisdom precipitated a 37% decline for the year. The StockJungle.com Community Intelligence Fund, for its part, was put out of its misery in August after losing about 36%. \nMost awkward PR flub: When Denver fund company Invesco agreed to pay $120 million over 20 years to slap its name on the Broncos stadium, it was no doubt angling for good press. So when a Denver Post columnist wrote that Invesco's own employees had dubbed it the \"Diaphragm,\" it had to hurt. Invesco threatened to sue but let up when it discovered that some staffers really did think the stadium bore a striking likeness to a gigantic birth-control device. \nHottest IPO: Let's just say 2001 wasn't exactly an ideal year to take your company public. September, in fact, had the distinction of being the first month since 1975 in which there were no IPOs whatsoever. Yet there were a few success stories, including the best performer (from the date the company went public to present): a Mountain View, Calif., company called Verisity, which makes software to detect flaws in electronic systems. Since its March IPO, the stock has doubled. \nShould've stayed private: Bringing up the rear in the IPO brigade was Seattle sandwich maker Briazz: Rattled working people shunned its pricey gourmet sandwiches, and investors lost their appetite as well- -the stock is down 88% since the IPO in May. \nNastiest boardroom battle: The acrimonious drama had more twists, turns, and 1980s-style backbiting than an episode of Dallas, but in the end Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles Wang triumphed over Texas investor Sam Wyly (who proposed a rival slate of directors, charging that Computer Associates had floundered under Wang's stewardship). \nBiggest boardroom upset: Lone shareholder Guy Adams got so fed up with Lone Star Steakhouse management that he ran against CEO Jamie Coulter for his board seat. Unbelievably, he won--by a reported 2.3 million votes. \nMost embarrassing Enron call: There was lots of competition here: bad calls, late calls, and gutless calls by analysts (not to mention the conference call in which CEO Jeffrey Skilling labeled one money manager an a--hole), but special distinction goes to Ron Barone of UBS Warburg, who lowered his rating on the stock from a strong buy to a hold--on Nov. 28, just days before Enron declared bankruptcy. Uh, thanks. \nBest makeover: The urge to merge raged this year as fund companies attempted to save face by folding hideous specialty funds into slightly less hideous tech funds. Strong Internet was merged into the Strong Technology 100 fund, and Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies was bled into the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. But proving yet again that it really is what's on the inside that counts, the Strong fund has so far lost 39%, and the Merrill fund is down 42%. \nGreatest career gamble: With a middling investing record on his resume, James Oberweis, dairy magnate and founder of the eponymous asset-management firm, announced he would vie for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. Perhaps in light of the markets' turbulence, anything looks easier than facing the Nasdaq. \nBest prediction for 2002: Finally, we wondered what investors could look forward to next year. Fund watchdog Weitz predicts that mutual fund marketing gurus are already dreaming up a spate of \"new reality\" funds filled with defense and biotech stocks. Not the most tasteful proposition, perhaps, but given this year's exploits, probably not far off the mark. Let's just hope it doesn't land them in the loser's circle next year. \nFeedback? investing@fortunemail.com\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: JOHN MUGGENBORG COLOR PHOTO: ANTHONY SAVIGNANO No Disney magic for the Basses, who got a margin call and had to sell COLOR PHOTO: PHOTOFEST [See caption above] COLOR PHOTO: WALTER P.

What follows are FORTUNE's picks for the most important business stories of an unforgettably tumultuous 2001.\nAlynda Wheat\n\n12/24/2001\nFortune Magazine \nTime Inc. \n113\n(Copyright 2001) \n\n1. 9.11 That the World Trade Center attacks could leave New York City $100 billion in the red seems oddly beside the point. They destroyed thousands of lives and livelihoods, shattered our nation's sense of security, and plunged us into war. \n2. The Recession With the market melting down, consumer confidence evaporating, and joblessness rising, not even Alan Greenspan's ten rate cuts--and another expected this month--could stave off recession. At least you lived to see the biggest boom ever. Now wave bye-bye.\n3. The Enron Implosion Thanks to the energy trader's dubious bookkeeping, Ken Lay went from running a $101 billion company to presiding over the biggest bankruptcy in history. \n4. California's Energy Crisis As energy became scarce, the state instituted rolling blackouts and spent $11 billion to bail out PG&E and SoCal Edison. While conservation stabilized soaring prices, the crisis--plus the Enron collapse--left the deregulation movement in tatters. \n5. Wall Street Analysts Henry Blodget and Mary Meeker were the poster children for Wall Street hype. But this was the year investors, burned by analysts' stock picks, stopped believing and started suing and booing. \n6. Team Bush No one expected much from the President and his advisors on foreign policy. The focus was supposed to be domestic policy, like the tax cut. Sept. 11 turned that around. Bush has emerged as a strong war leader, but his legacy could still depend upon reviving the economy. \n7. Telecom Meltdown If you think this Lucent office looks empty, ask one of the company's employees about his 401(k). The entire industry suffered stupefying losses thanks to bad investments and wishful thinking. \n8. China Being selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics wasn't the country's only big win. After years of tense negotiation, China gained entry to the World Trade Organization. \n9. Microsoft Why is Bill Gates smiling? Maybe because his Teflon tech firm slipped a Justice Department noose, shook an avalanche of bad press, launched the XP operating system, and unveiled the coveted Xbox game console. \n10.Ford Chairman Bill Ford ousted bare-knuckled CEO Jacques Nasser after a year of nightmarish PR, pricey foreign investments that left the company scrounging for cash, and lawsuits that ended the nearly century-old relationship between Ford and Firestone. The scion has a tough road ahead.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: MIKE KEPKA--SFC/CORBIS SABA California's energy crisis--one of the top ten business stories of 2001--inspired Rick and Karen Dorantes to cut their energy use in half by running appliances off car batteries.

I hope this letter finds you in the best of health. I think I speak for everybody when I tell you that we've been very, very good this time around, so this is going to be a rather long list. Grab something wet, pull up a Barcalounger, and pay attention.\nAt the outset, let me say I consider it a miracle that this letter reached you at all. I figure you have security up the wazoo, what with all the wackos sending stuff through the snail mail. That whole drill has to make your job a lot tougher. Be patient, Santa, and don't cut corners. Don't get complacent. There's more than one evildoer who would love to take the blush out of the cheeks of a symbol of Western hedonism like you. But don't worry about this letter, of course! If there's any white powder on the envelope, it came from one of the freshly baked doughnuts I have waiting on the mantle for your upcoming visit! \nAnyhow, this year it's clear that many, many people are a lot more needy than I am, so in the spirit of the season I'm gonna ask for their presents first. \nI should start, I guess, with the poor folks at Andersen, the accounting and consulting firm. Boy, Santa, do those guys need some new calculators! Please get a whole bunch for them. They approved the books for the fellows over at Enron, whose earnings didn't turn out to really be what they said they were at first. Then they had to restate them. Was their collective face red! I'm sure if the Andersen people had better equipment, they wouldn't have screwed up like that with Enron, or with all the other corporations they seemingly permitted to wank around with their numbers in exchange for hefty consulting fees. \nWhile we're at it, I suppose we can't ignore the senior management that used to run Enron either. What a bunch of boneheads! But this is the holiday time of year, Santa, the season of forgiveness and giving, so why not make their executive homes your first stop? They need a lot, Santa. To start with, they're gonna want, like, thousands of hours of legal time from expensive firms, so give them that. And why not throw in a couple of files they can bake into cakes for later on? \nOn your way out of town, forget about toys and games and stuff like that and just please leave a ton of money under the tree of every Enron employee, particularly the fired ones, and of course the older ones who thought they were going to have something to retire on. And as for the financial planners who allowed employees' 401(k)s to hold solely the company's stock, I suppose you should bring very special presents for them too...I can't think of what, though...How about we let the Enron work force figure that one out? \nThere are so many business executives to think about this year too. Most of them you could make happy with fractional growth in Ebitda for the quarter. That would be a huge surprise, and you know how much executives like pleasant surprises! \nBill Gates? You don't need to bring anything for him, Santa. He has just about everything, you know, and what he doesn't have, he can certainly take over and repackage as part of his operating system. But I guess you should try to make sure that there's an Xbox under every American child's tree this year, and a couple of games too, particularly the one where those buff girls in tiny Spandex outfits throw each other around. Just knowing he was making so many children happy would bring a seasonal smile to Bill's Microface. \nOh. Make a very special trip to Carly Fiorina too. She's the woman who runs Hewlett-Packard, you know. She worked so hard this year and had so much aggravation, Santa, so...could you please make Walter Hewlett go away? He's the son of the founder, and he's being a real party pooper! He thinks that the merger is bad for a lot of stupid reasons...like something about how it will draw the company away from its core competencies in printing and focus it on the low-margin computer-manufacturing side of the business, but when you get right down to it, he's simply being a bummer, that's all. Please, Santa. Bring Carly her merger. She's staked her whole reputation--and her bonus next year--on the outcome, and, you know, any CEO who is willing to risk compensation on something must want it really, really bad. \nWhile you're at it, please bring John Chambers, the head of Cisco, a good stock price right away. The poor fellow has six million options riding on it. Four million of them are underwater, but more recently the company gave him two million more at a strike price of $18.50, and they should be worth something, don't you think? If you don't, Mr. Chambers will really feel that $268,131 he gave up in salary to show he knows that corporations should pay for performance and nothing less. \nGee, this is getting kind of long, and I haven't even gotten to myself yet! So, just briefly, bring Alan Greenspan something nice but healthy, Santa--very, very healthy, no cigars or liquor. Vitamins! Yeah! And let's see...oh, yes, bring the Internet some genuine advertising revenue, will you? It could really use it. And don't forget to leave the folks over at the New York Times business section some Prozac. Or Viagra, maybe. Anything to cheer them up. \nFor myself, now...well, I guess I have just about everything a man could want, so I'll just mention a few of the things I could do without. Bring me no cutbacks in my stocking, Santa, for me or my friends, and no smallpox, and no anthrax, and no particular reasons to travel anywhere by plane, at least for a while. And most of all please do not bring a suitcase with a nuclear weapon in it for anybody I know, and even the people I don't. Other than that, I could always use a new car. Anything will do, as long as the top goes down. And a phone even tinier than the one I have, to show I'm getting more powerful. And hey, keep this global warming going on. It's great! \nNow get busy, my man! You're gonna need plenty of time before takeoff this year, you know, to interview all the reindeer twice after conducting extensive background checks on all of them, especially Rudolph, whose nose always looked a little red to me, and to X-ray all those packages, no matter how small they might be, while making sure nothing has been placed in the baggage compartments underneath your sleigh by the grinches who want to steal a whole lot more than Christmas. Fly safe, Santa! We need you more than ever this year! \nOh--and while you're over Iraq, if you happen to spot a suspicious factory or laboratory of any sort, don't forget to pop a nice little present down its chimney, from--and for--all of us. \nFeliz Navidad, baby! \nBy day, STANLEY BING is a real executive at a real FORTUNE 500 company he'd rather not name. He can be reached at stanleybing@aol.com.\n\nCOLOR ILLUSTRATION: MILAN TRENC \n..................................................................................................................................... \n\nFeatures/The Credit Watchers\nThe Geeks Who Rule The World ; There's a reason Moody's and S&P have been doing so well. Their customers can't say no.\nBethany McLean; Reporter Associate Doris Burke\n\n12/24/2001\nFortune Magazine \nTime Inc. \n93\n(Copyright 2001) \n\nOn Nov. 28, when Standard & Poor's and then Moody's downgraded Enron's debt below the all-important status \"investment grade,\" the company's bankruptcy became a foregone conclusion. The downgrades confirmed that Enron would no longer be able to support its trading operations by accessing the capital markets, and they triggered the repayment of billions of dollars of debt. \nBut the one-two credit punches pointed not just to a TKO of Enron. They were also a reminder of the immense and seemingly ever- increasing power of the agencies themselves. A much-coveted triple-A rating (the highest grade) is the grease in an otherwise squeaky engine. It makes every aspect of doing business easier, from raising money to convincing customers that operations are solid. In contrast, an S&P or Moody's downgrade is a fearsome event that can dramatically increase a company's cost of capital, perhaps even destroy its ability to raise money. As one critic put it decades ago, they retain an \"almost biblical authority.\"\nThat's because the rating agencies--private, for-profit companies that are privy to insider information--have come to play a quasi- regulatory role in the market. Many big investors, from pension funds to insur-ance companies to money market funds, are prohibited from owning more than a set amount of lower-rated debt, for instance. \nBut while the Enron debacle is evidence of the agencies' power, it also brings some long-simmering criticism--think back to 1975, when the agencies failed to downgrade New York City's debt until the city's fiscal crisis was obvious--to a frothy boil. Critics say that the credit czars, for all their inside access, didn't identify this borrower's woes any earlier than the rest of us did--and they didn't downgrade the debt even after the severity of the problems was well known. Indeed, prior to the downgrades, Enron's debt was trading at around 50 cents on the dollar, a sign that the market had already dismissed the company's investment-grade status as farce. \"The rating agencies are always late,\" grouses one portfolio manager. \nOf course, neither John Rutherfurd, the CEO of Moody's, nor Leo O'Neill, S&P's president, see things that way. \"We communicated our view [that Enron's rating was dependent on its merger with Dynegy] clearly and frequently,\" says O'Neill. Adds Rutherford: \"We do not want to rush to judgment nor do we delay in informing investors when we believe fundamentals have changed.\" \nHow can the same entities be all-powerful and strangely after-the- fact at the same time? That is one of the more puzzling conundrums in today's capital markets. The nearly regulatory function of the agencies and the weight their opinions carry make their judgments critical--but also complicated. The agencies can be not just observers but active participants in the course of events. That's because a downgrade can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: If the rating agencies act too rashly, they could be accused of causing a bankruptcy. Yet if they deliberate too long, they'll simply be stating what everyone already knows--especially since today, unlike in the '70s, there is an army of outside fixed-income analysts that both challenge the rating agencies' judgments and profit from anticipating their actions. \nTrue, this debate rarely reaches Enron-esque proportions. And it's worth emphasizing that corporate debt is just a small part of these agencies' purviews. They analyze almost every fixed-income instrument out there, from the debt of China to the complex bonds backed by cash flows from, say, the Mississippi tobacco settlement. Their power, in fact, is very much entwined with that omnipresence. Moody's alone claims that it rates more than $30 trillion of the world's debt from over 100 countries, 4,200 corporations, and 68,000 public finance obligations. \nWhat's more, the agencies appear, in the wide lens of history, to be fairly accurate in their judgments: As both O'Neill and Rutherfurd note, it's rare that investment- grade credits go kaput. Both agencies have statistics showing that less than 1% of bonds rated A- or better default over a five-year period. In addition, around 85% of the credits in the domestic A class still hold the rating at year- end, implying stability in higher-rated bonds. \nBut by its sheer size the Enron implosion challenges that perception of stability. And it draws attention to the agencies at a particularly interesting time--for Moody's especially. Until recently the actual businesses of Moody's and S&P were hidden away inside much larger companies. S&P is still buried within McGraw-Hill. But in October 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun Moody's out as a separate company. For the first time ever, outsiders can perform a credit check on a rating agency. \nCombing through Moody's financials makes one thing perfectly clear: Credit rating is a fabulous business. Since its spinoff, Moody's stock has climbed--yes, climbed--some 40%, giving Moody's the same market value as Bear Stearns. This year the rating agency is expected to generate about $770 million in revenues (less than a tenth of Bear's revenues) and an astounding $382 million in operating income. And Moody's does this with just 1,600 employees. Perhaps it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the company's largest shareholder, owning just about 15% of the stock. Henry Berghoef of Harris Associates, another large Moody's holder, says that the biggest challenge facing CEO Rutherfurd is the proper management of the company's immense free cash flow. Rutherfurd himself, a scholarly, white-haired 62-year-old, has few complaints. \"It's a big thrill,\" he says. \nIndeed, what's not to like? For one thing, Moody's potential customers almost can't say no. As Merrill analyst Joanne Park wrote in a recent report, \"In many cases, a Moody's rating is practically a prerequisite for coming to market with a new issue of fixed-income securities.\" Like an investment bank, Moody's is a big beneficiary of the long-term growth in the capital markets--without even having to risk its own capital. Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear Stearns, calculates that over the past 20 years Moody's revenue and profits grew at compound annual rates of 16% and 15%, respectively--a growth trend he terms \"incredible.\" (Rutherfurd adds that in the past 20 years, profits have fallen only once, in 1994.) In recent years Moody's has stabilized its revenue still further, basically creating an annuity stream by instituting what it calls \"relationship pricing.\" Instead of hiring Moody's on a transactional basis, some of its customers now pay an annual fee; in return, Moody's rates every bond issue they do. \"Relationship pricing\" now accounts for 36% of Moody's revenues. \nBoth Moody's and S&P have also done a remarkable job of keeping pace with innovations in the capital markets. Witness the explosion of a new type of debt known as \"structured finance\"--a bond, for instance, backed by the cash flow from residential mortgages. Here the rating is everything: It measures the level of risk in an extremely complicated security and determines the yield that must be paid to attract investors. \"The rating agencies play an integral role in distributing paper into the marketplace,\" says Kevin Rigby, head of Deutsche Bank's rating advisory business, which helps Deutsche's clients argue their cases to the rating agencies. (In yet another indication of the agencies' power, many of the major investment banks have entire departments that do this.) Structured finance is now Moody's largest business, accounting for one-third of its revenues, up from almost nothing in the late 1980s. \nAs Moody's pushes aggressively into new markets, it has expanded its power base as well. Rutherfurd is especially excited about Europe, which currently accounts for about 20% of the company's sales. He notes happily that there are about 1,500 unrated companies with revenues greater than one billion euros. \"Money coming out of banking and into the capital markets should propel growth in ratings for the next decade,\" he says, quickly adding, \"But we love banks too.\" Indeed. Recently the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that ratings be used globally to determine banks' capital adequacy. (The proposal seems to be on hold for now.) \nThis is certainly not a state of affairs that John Moody would have imagined when he began providing statistics on railroad bonds back in 1909. In the beginning it was all very simple: Investors paid for Moody's research, which helped disseminate important information to the market. Some two decades later the government was mandating that banks use ratings to determine the values of their investment portfolios. Then, in the second half of the century, the SEC began to rely on ratings to determine what sort of securities insurance companies, pension plans, broker-dealers, and money market funds could own. Both Moody's and S&P resisted those developments for a number of reasons--but they didn't say no. \"I don't think that ratings should be used to determine investment policy,\" O'Neill maintains today; Moody's has written a number of letters protesting the use of ratings in regulatory policy. \nAnother substantial change occurred around 1970. Prior to that time Moody's and S&P had always earned their keep from investor subscriptions. Given the growing volume of work, however, those economics no longer made sense. So first Moody's and then S&P began to charge issuers instead. There's a constant worry that this poses a conflict of interest. But unlike equity analysts, the credit analysts don't have to worry about buying business with favorable ratings. Companies simply don't have a lot of choice. \nThe most controversial development came in 1975 when the SEC, worried that fly-by-night rating agencies could wreak havoc on the market, initiated a mouthful of a designation, the \"nationally recognized statistical rating organization,\" or NSRSO. To comply with various SEC regulations, a company's rating had to come from an NSRSO- -essentially, Moody's, S&P, or Fitch, a smaller competitor that is a subsidiary of French concern Fimalac. The designation has become the subject of intense debate. \"The SEC has enveloped [the agencies] in a very protective webbing that keeps anyone else from challenging them,\" says Lawrence White, an economics professor at NYU. \"There they are, a 2 1/2-firm industry, sitting pretty.\" But no one has a better idea. Says Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner who is now an attorney at Thelen Reid & Priest: \"It's a very uncomfortable situation, but it's impractical to take out what is already there.\" \nThere have been other complaints about the clout the agencies have- -Moody's in particular. In the early 1990s allegations began to swirl that Moody's bullied municipalities into hiring it by issuing unsolicited (and negative) ratings to those that declined the offer. One Colorado school district sued the rater after it made negative comments about a pending bond sale, claiming that investors used the pan to demand a higher interest rate, resulting in a net loss of $769,000. The court ruled that Moody's ratings were opinions, not facts--and therefore the company was protected under the First Amendment. \nBut that hardly settles the broader issue: In the capital markets the ratings can function as facts even if they aren't. That's because of the numerous regulations that are built around them. The Continental Divide is between investment-grade securities and non- investment-grade securities, because many investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, are permitted to own only a certain quantity of lower-quality bonds. And many money market funds are allowed to have just 5% of their assets in commercial paper that doesn't carry a top rating. So when Moody's and S&P downgraded Ford Motor's debt in October, Gary Zeltzer, head of investment-grade fixed income at J.W. Seligman, had no choice but to sell. (While Ford's debt sold off on the downgrade, it now trades at a better price than it did before.) \nAnd that brings us back to the Enron question: How much should credit ratings anticipate the verdict of the stock market? O'Neill insists that his firm cannot afford to rush to judgment; it doesn't bother him at all, he says, if a bond trades at a different level than its rating implies: \"The market tends to be much more near-term focused. We need to be diligent and make sure we do our work.\" Richard Waugh, an analyst at the Principal Financial Group, agrees. \"What [the agencies] do moves markets and affects the flow of capital. So they have to make very sure that they're right, and they lean over backward to accomplish that.\" \nBut Moody's Rutherfurd has a different point of view. \"If a credit is deteriorating, we want to be the first to spot it,\" he says. He jumps up to an easel, looking very professorial, to talk about the \"Merton model\"--basically, a way of incorporating the judgment of the equity market into ratings. In his view, that's important, because the equity market is forward-looking, whereas accounting data are reflective of the past. \"We think we're way ahead of S&P in doing this,\" he boasts. Nor does Rutherfurd seem to bristle at the recent criticism. \"I hate the word 'optimal,' \" he says. \"But we do the best we can, and we think it's pretty good.\" \nThat \"pretty good\" is likely to be as good as it gets--barring a few more Enron-caliber events, the credit-rating system isn't likely to change. As First Union analyst Asa Graves says of Moody's, \"They would have to really shoot themselves in the foot to lose serious market position.\" \nREPORTER ASSOCIATE Doris Burke \nFEEDBACK: bmclean@fortunemail.com\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY MATTHEW SALACUSE Creditworthy John Rutherfurd, Moody's CEO, in his New York office COLOR CHART: FORTUNE CHART Moody's Big Move Stock price index Nov. 30, 2000 = 100 Moody's S&P 500 B/W PHOTO John Moody, the founding father COLOR PHOTO: MICHELE ASSELIN Leo O'Neill is content with S&P's role. \n..................................................................................................................................... \n\nFeatures/Cover Stories\nWhy Enron Went Bust ; Start with arrogance. Add greed, deceit, and financial chicanery. What do you get? A company that wasn't what it was cracked up to be.\nBethany McLean; Additional Reporting by Nicholas Varchaver, John Helyar, ; Janice Revell, and Jessica Sung\n\n12/24/2001\nFortune Magazine \nTime Inc. \n58\n(Copyright 2001) \n\n\"Our business is not a black box. It's very simple to model. People who raise questions are people who have not gone through it in detail. We have explicit answers, but people want to throw rocks at us.\" \nSo said Enron's then-CEO, Jeff Skilling, in an interview I had with him last February. At the time--less than ten months ago, let's recall--Enron's market capitalization was around $60 billion, just a shade below its all-time high, and its status as a Wall Street darling had not yet begun to crumble. I was working on a story that would ultimately raise questions about Enron's valuation, and I'd called with what I considered fairly standard queries in an effort to understand its nearly incomprehensible financial statements. The response from Enron was anything but standard. Skilling quickly became frustrated, said that the line of inquiry was \"unethical,\" and hung up the phone. A short time later Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer called and offered to come to FORTUNE's New York City office with then-CFO Andy Fastow and investor-relations head Mark Koenig. \"We want to make sure we've answered your questions completely and accurately,\" he said.\nNow, in the wake of Enron's stunning collapse, it looks as if the company's critics didn't throw enough rocks. The world is clamoring for those \"explicit answers,\" but Skilling, long gone from Enron-- and avoiding the press on the advice of his lawyers--is in no position to provide them. As for \"completely and accurately,\" many would argue that the men running Enron never understood either concept. \"One way to hide a log is to put it in the woods,\" says Michigan Democrat John Dingell, who is calling for a congressional investigation. \"What we're looking at here is an example of superbly complex financial reports. They didn't have to lie. All they had to do was to obfuscate it with sheer complexity--although they probably lied too.\" \nUntil recently Enron would kick and scream at the notion that its business or financial statements were complicated; its attitude, expressed with barely concealed disdain, was that anyone who couldn't understand its business just didn't \"get it.\" Many Wall Street analysts who followed the company were content to go along. Bulls, including David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, admitted that they had to take the company's word on its numbers--but it wasn't a problem, you see, because Enron delivered what the Street most cared about: smoothly growing earnings. Of course, now that it's clear that those earnings weren't what they appeared, the new cliche is that Enron's business was incredibly complicated--perhaps even too complicated for founder Ken Lay to understand (something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title from Skilling last summer). Which leads to a basic question: Why were so many people willing to believe in something that so few actually understood? \nOf course, since the Enron collapse, there are other basic questions as well--questions for which there are still no adequate answers. Even today, with creditors wrangling over Enron's skeletal remains while the company tries desperately to find a backer willing to keep its trading operations in business, outsiders still don't know what went wrong. Neither do Enron's employees, many of whom expressed complete shock as their world cratered. Was Enron's ultimate collapse caused by a crisis of confidence in an otherwise solid company? Or were the sleazy financial dealings that precipitated that crisis--including mysterious off-balance-sheet partnerships run by Enron executives--the company's method of covering up even deeper issues in an effort to keep the stock price rising? And then there's the question that's been swirling around the business community and in Enron's hometown of Houston: Given the extent to which financial chicanery appears to have take place, is someone going to jail? \nA CULTURE OF ARROGANCE \nIf you believe the old saying that \"those whom the gods would destroy they first make proud,\" perhaps this saga isn't so surprising. \"Arrogant\" is the word everyone uses to describe Enron. It was an attitude epitomized by the banner in Enron's lobby: THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY. There was the company's powerful belief that older, stodgier competitors had no chance against the sleek, modern Enron juggernaut. \"These big companies will topple over from their own weight,\" Skilling said last year, referring to old-economy behemoths like Exxon Mobil. A few years ago at a conference of utility executives, \"Skilling told all the folks he was going to eat their lunch,\" recalls Southern Co. executive Dwight Evans. (\"People find that amusing today,\" adds Evans.) Or how about Skilling's insistence last winter that the company's stock--then about $80 a share--should sell for $126 a share? Jim Alexander, the former CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, which was spun off in 1994, once worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and sees similarities. \"The common theme is hubris, an overweening pride, which led people to believe they can handle increasingly exotic risk without danger.\" \nTo be sure, for a long time it seemed as though Enron had much to be arrogant about. The company, which Ken Lay helped create in 1985 from the merger of two gas pipelines, really was a pioneer in trading natural gas and electricity. It really did build new markets for the trading of, say, weather futures. For six years running, it was voted Most Innovative among FORTUNE's Most Admired Companies. Led by Skilling, who had joined the company in 1990 from consulting firm McKinsey (he succeeded Lay as CEO in February 2001), Enron operated under the belief that it could commoditize and monetize anything, from electrons to advertising space. By the end of the decade, Enron, which had once made its money from hard assets like pipelines, generated more than 80% of its earnings from a vaguer business known as \"wholesale energy operations and services.\" From 1998 to 2000, Enron's revenues shot from $31 billion to more than $100 billion, making it the seventh-largest company on the FORTUNE 500. And in early 2000, just as broadband was becoming a buzzword worth billions in market value, Enron announced plans to trade that too. \nBut that culture had a negative side beyond the inbred arrogance. Greed was evident, even in the early days. \"More than anywhere else, they talked about how much money we would make,\" says someone who worked for Skilling. Compensation plans often seemed oriented toward enriching executives rather than generating profits for shareholders. For instance, in Enron's energy services division, which managed the energy needs of large companies like Eli Lilly, executives were compensated based on a market valuation formula that relied on internal estimates. As a result, says one former executive, there was pressure to, in effect, inflate the value of the contracts--even though it had no impact on the actual cash that was generated. \nBecause Enron believed it was leading a revolution, it encouraged flouting the rules. There was constant gossip that this rule breaking extended to executives' personal lives--rumors of sexual high jinks in the executive ranks ran rampant. Enron also developed a reputation for ruthlessness, both external and internal. Skilling is usually credited with creating a system of forced rankings for employees, in which those rated in the bottom 20% would leave the company. Thus, employees attempted to crush not just outsiders but each other. \"Enron was built to maximize value by maximizing the individual parts,\" says an executive at a competing energy firm. Enron traders, he adds, were afraid to go to the bathroom because the guy sitting next to them might use information off their screen to trade against them. And because delivering bad news had career-wrecking potential, problems got papered over--especially, says one former employee, in the trading operation. \"People perpetuated this myth that there were never any mistakes. It was astounding to me.\" \nTRADING SECRETS \n\"We're not a trading company,\" said Fastow during that February visit. \"We are not in the business of making money by speculating.\" He also pointed out that over the past five years, Enron had reported 20 straight quarters of increasing income. \"There's not a trading company in the world that has that kind of consistency,\" he said. \"That's the check at the end of the day.\" \nIn fact, it's next to impossible to find someone outside Enron who agrees with Fastow's contention. \"They were not an energy company that used trading as a part of their strategy, but a company that traded for trading's sake,\" says Austin Ramzy, research director of Principal Capital Income Investors. \"Enron is dominated by pure trading,\" says one competitor. Indeed, Enron had a reputation for taking more risk than other companies, especially in longer-term contracts, in which there is far less liquidity. \"Enron swung for the fences,\" says another trader. And it's no secret that among non- investment banks, Enron was an active and extremely aggressive player in complex financial instruments such as credit derivatives. Because Enron didn't have as strong a balance sheet as the investment banks that dominate that world, it had to offer better prices to get business. \"Funky\" is a word that is used to describe its trades. \nBut there's an obvious explanation for why Enron didn't want to disclose the extent to which it was a trading company. For Enron, it was all about the price of the stock, and trading companies, with their inherently volatile earnings, simply aren't rewarded with rich valuations. Look at Goldman Sachs: One of the best trading outfits in the world, its stock rarely sells for more than 20 times earnings, vs. the 70 or so multiple that Enron shares commanded at their peak. You'll never hear Goldman's management predicting the precise amount it will earn next year--yet Enron's management predicted earnings practically to the penny. The odd mismatch between what Enron's management said and what others say isn't just an academic debate. The question goes to the heart of Enron's valuation, which was based on its ability to generate predictable earnings. \nWhy didn't that disconnect seem to matter? Because like Enron's management, investors cared only about the stock price too. And as long as Enron posted the earnings it promised (and talked up big ideas like broadband), the stock price was supposed to keep on rising- -as, indeed, it did for a while. Institutions like Janus, Fidelity, and Alliance Capital piled in. Of course, earnings growth isn't the entire explanation for Wall Street's attitude. There were also the enormous investment-banking fees Enron generated. Nor was asking questions easy. Wall Streeters find it hard to admit that they don't understand something. And Skilling was notoriously short with those who didn't immediately concur with the Enron world-view. \"If you didn't act like a light bulb came on pretty quick, Skilling would dismiss you,\" says one portfolio manager. \"They had Wall Street beaten into submission,\" he adds. \nWHERE ARE THE PROFITS? \nAlthough it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the tide began to turn against Enron, it's not hard to find the person who first said that the emperor had no clothes. In early 2001, Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a highly regarded firm that specializes in short- selling, said publicly what now seems obvious: No one could explain how Enron actually made money. Chanos also pointed out that while Enron's business seemed to resemble nothing so much as a hedge fund-- \"a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline,\" in the memorable words of Doug Millett, Kynikos' chief operating officer--it simply didn't make very much money. Enron's operating margin had plunged from around 5% in early 2000 to under 2% by early 2001, and its return on invested capital hovered at 7%--a figure that does not include Enron's off-balance-sheet debt, which, as we now know, was substantial. \"I wouldn't put my money in a hedge fund earning a 7% return,\" scoffed Chanos, who also pointed out that Skilling was aggressively selling shares--hardly the behavior of someone who believed his $80 stock was really worth $126. \nNot only was Enron surprisingly unprofitable, but its cash flow from operations seemed to bear little relationship to reported earnings. Because much of Enron's business was booked on a \"mark to market\" basis, in which a company estimates the fair value of a contract and runs quarterly fluctuations through the income statement, reported earnings didn't correspond to the actual cash coming in the door. That isn't necessarily bad--as long as the cash shows up at some point. But over time Enron's operations seemed to consume a lot of cash; on-balance-sheet debt climbed from $3.5 billion in 1996 to $13 billion at last report. \nSkilling and Fastow had a simple explanation for Enron's low returns. The \"distorting factor,\" in Fastow's words, was Enron's huge investments in international pipelines and plants reaching from India to Brazil. Skilling told analysts that Enron was shedding those underperforming old-line assets as quickly as it could and that the returns in Enron's newer businesses were much, much higher. It's undeniable that Enron did make a number of big, bad bets on overseas projects--in fact, India and Brazil are two good examples. But in truth, no one on the outside (and few people inside Enron) can independently measure how profitable--or more to the point, how consistently profitable--Enron's trading operations really were. A former employee says that Skilling and his circle refused to detail the return on capital that the trading business generated, instead pointing to reported earnings, just as Fastow did. By the late 1990s much of Enron's asset portfolio had been lumped in with its trading operations for reporting purposes. Chanos noted that Enron was selling those assets and booking them as recurring revenue. In addition, Enron took equity stakes in all kinds of companies and included results from those investments in the figures it reported. \nChanos was also the first person to pay attention to the infamous partnerships. In poring over Enron documents, he took note of an odd and opaque mention of transactions that Enron and other \"Entities\" had done with a \"Related Party\" that was run by \"a senior officer of Enron.\" Not only was it impossible to understand what that meant, but it also raised a conflict-of-interest issue, given that an Enron senior executive--CFO Fastow, as it turns out--ran the \"Related Party\" entities. These, we now know, refer to the LJM partnerships. \nWhen it came to the \"Related Party\" transactions, Enron didn't even pretend to be willing to answer questions. Back in February, Fastow (who at the time didn't admit his involvement) said that the details were \"confidential\" because Enron \"didn't want information to get into the market.\" Then he explained that the partnerships were used for \"unbundling and reassembling\" the various components of a contract. \"We strip out price risk, we strip out interest rate risk, we strip out all the risks,\" he said. \"What's left may not be something that we want.\" The obvious question is, Why would anyone else want whatever was left either? But perhaps that didn't matter, because the partnerships were supported with Enron stock--which, you remember, wasn't supposed to decline in value. \nSKILLING SENDS A SIGNAL \nBy mid-August enough questions had been raised about Enron's credibility that the stock had begun falling; it had dropped from $80 at the beginning of the year to the low 40s. And then came what should have been the clearest signal yet of serious problems: Jeff Skilling's shocking announcement that he was leaving the company. Though Skilling never gave a plausible reason for his departure, Enron dismissed any suggestion that his departure was related to possible problems with the company. Now, however, there are those who speculate that Skilling knew the falling stock price would wreak havoc on the partnerships--and cause their exposure. \"He saw what was coming, and he didn't have the emotional fortitude to deal with it,\" says a former employee. \nWhat's astonishing is that even in the face of this dramatic--and largely inexplicable--event, people were still willing to take Enron at its word. Ken Lay, who stepped back into his former role as CEO, retained immense credibility on Wall Street and with Enron's older employees, who gave him a standing ovation at a meeting announcing his return. He said there were no \"accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues\" at Enron, and people believed him. Lay promised to restore Enron's credibility by improving its disclosure practices, which he finally admitted had been less than adequate. \nDid Lay have any idea of what he was talking about? Or was he as clueless as Enron's shareholders? Most people believe the latter. But even when Lay clearly did know an important piece of information, he seemed to be more inclined to bury it, Enron-style, than to divulge it. After all, Enron's now infamous Oct. 16 press release--the one that really marked the beginning of the end, in which it announced a $618 million loss but failed to mention that it had written down shareholders' equity by a stunning $1.2 billion--went out under Lay's watch. And Lay failed to mention a critical fact on the subsequent conference call: that Moody's was considering a downgrade of Enron's debt. (Although Skilling said last February that Enron's off-balance- sheet debt was \"non-recourse\" to Enron, it turns out that that wasn't quite true either. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of Enron's on-balance-sheet debt below investment grade, Enron could be forced to repay it.) \nIndeed, facing a now nearly constant barrage of criticism, Enron seemed to retreat further and further from Lay's promises of full disclosure. The rather vague reason that Enron first gave for that huge reduction in shareholders' equity was the \"early termination\" of the LJM partnerships. That was far from enough to satisfy investors, especially as the Wall Street Journal began to ferret out pieces of information related to the partnerships, including the fact that Fastow had been paid millions for his role at the LJMs. As recently as Oct. 23, Lay insisted that Enron had access to cash, that the business was \"performing very well,\" and that Fastow was a standup guy who was being unnecessarily smeared. The very next day Enron announced that Fastow would take a leave of absence. \nWe now know, of course, that Enron's dealings with its various related parties had a huge impact on the earnings it reported. On Nov. 8, an eye-popping document told investors that Enron was restating its earnings for the past 4 3/4 years because \"three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated in the financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.\" The restatement reduced earnings by almost $600 million, or about 15%, and contained a warning that Enron could still find \"additional or different information.\" \nAnd sophisticated investors who have scrutinized the list of selected transactions between Enron and its various partnerships are still left with more questions than answers. The speculation is that the partnerships were used to even out Enron's earnings. Which leads to another set of questions: If Enron had ceased its game playing and come completely clean, would the company have survived? Or did Enron fail to come clean precisely because the real story would have been even more scandalous? \nTHE LAST GASP \nOn the surface, the facts that led to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing are quite straightforward. For a few weeks it looked as if Dynegy (which had long prided itself on being the anti-Enron) would bail out its flailing rival by injecting it with an immediate $1.5 billion in cash, secured by an option on Enron's key pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and then purchasing all of Enron for roughly $10 billion (not including debt). But by Nov. 28 the deal had fallen apart. On that day Standard & Poor's downgraded Enron's debt below investment grade, triggering the immediate repayment of almost $4 billion in off-balance-sheet debt--which Enron couldn't pay. \nBut even this denouement comes with its own set of plot twists. Both companies are suing each other: Enron claims that Dynegy wrongfully terminated the deal, \"consistently took advantage of Enron's precarious state to further its own business goals,\" and as a result has no right to Enron's Northern Natural pipeline. Dynegy calls Enron's suit \"one more example of Enron's failure to take responsibility for its demise.\" No one can predict how the suits will pan out, but one irony is clear: Enron, that new-economy superstar, is battling to hang on to its very old-economy pipeline. \nTo hear Dynegy tell it, a central rationale for abandoning the deal was what might be called the mystery of the missing cash. General counsel Ken Randolph says that Dynegy expected Enron to have some $3 billion in cash--but an Enron filing revealed just over $1 billion. \"We went back to Enron and we asked, 'Where did the cash go? Where did the cash go?' \" says CEO Chuck Watson. \"Perhaps their core business was not as strong as they had led us to believe,\" speculates Randolph. Dynegy also claims that Enron tried to keep secrets to the last. Enron's lack of cash was revealed to the world in a filing on the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19. Watson says he got the document only a few hours earlier--but that Lay had a copy on Friday. \"I was not happy,\" says Watson. \"It's not good form to surprise your partner.\" \nSagas like this one inevitably wind up in the courts--and Enron's is no exception. Given that credit-rating agency Fitch estimates that even senior unsecured-debt holders will get only 20% to 40% of their money back, the battles among Enron's various creditors are likely to be fierce. Nor has Enron itself conceded yet. The company's biggest lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have extended $1.5 billion of \"debtor in possession\" financing to Enron, which will enable it to continue to operate at least for a while. And Enron is still searching for a bank that will back it in restarting its trading business. \nIn the meantime, the courts will also be trying to answer a key question: Who should pay? Enron's Chapter 11 filing automatically freezes all suits against the company itself while the bankruptcy is resolved. But while Enron may seek the same protection for its executives, lawyers predict that the attempt will fail and that the individuals will have to fend off a raft of suits. Some think that criminal charges are a possibility for former executives like Skilling and Fastow. But such cases require proof of \"knowing, willful, intentional misconduct,\" says well-known defense attorney Ira Sorkin. And a criminal case requires a much higher standard of proof than a civil case: proof beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a preponderance of the evidence. That's a high bar, especially since Enron executives will probably claim that they had Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, approving their every move. With Enron in bankruptcy, Arthur Andersen is now the deepest available pocket, and the shareholder suits are already piling up. \nIn any conversation about Enron, the comparison with Long-Term Capital Management invariably crops up. In some ways, it looks as if the cost of the Enron debacle is far less than that of LTCM--far less than anyone would have thought possible, in fact (see next story). But in other ways the cost is far greater. Enron was a public company with employees and shareholders who counted on management, the board, and the auditors to protect them. That's why one senior Wall Streeter says of the Enron saga, \"It disgusts me, and it frightens me.\" And that's why, regardless of how the litigation plays out, it feels as though a crime has been committed. \nFEEDBACK: bmclean@fortunemail.com \nAdditional reporting by Nicholas Varchaver, John Helyar, Janice Revell, and Jessica Sung \nQuote: Among the still unanswered questions swirling around Enron is this one: Is someone going to wind up in jail?

In September the bankrupt energy concern paid $10,000 to sponsor this sculpture as part of CowParade Houston 2001, the latest iteration of the fundraiser-cum-public-art-project. The cow--called Moost Imoovative and created by Jason C. Alkire--sat in front of Enron headquarters through early November. In retrospect it could be seen as a warning: The bovine, like its sponsor, is a house of mirrors, reflecting the viewer but offering no insight into its content. On Dec. 6 the cow was sold at a charity auction for $8,000. Heck, is the whole company even worth that much? \n--Jason Tanz\n\n\nCOLOR PHOTO \n..................................................................................................................................... \n\nFeatures/The Recovery\nWill The Economy Get Well Soon? ; The Fed has been slashing rates with a vengeance, but a credit squeeze could really hurt the recovery.\nAnna Bernasek\n\n12/24/2001\nFortune Magazine \nTime Inc. \n89\n(Copyright 2001) \n\nWhen it comes to recessions, economists believe in a simple rule of thumb: Pump money and credit into an ailing economy, and before long you have a recovery. The bigger the injection, the stronger the rebound. So between Alan Greenspan's yearlong campaign to slash interest rates and the government's latest stimulus package, totaling $75 billion, we should get one mind-blowing recovery, right? After all, the last time we pumped so much money into the economy was in the early 1960s, and things turned out pretty groovy back then. \nUnfortunately, it may not be so simple this time. Eight months into this recession, consumers are still buying big-ticket items like cars and homes. While that has kept the economy from totally tanking, it leaves little pent-up consumer demand to drive a fast recovery. So it's all up to corporate America--which, you'll recall, got us into this mess in the first place. As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, puts it, \"The difference between a strong recovery and a disappointing one will depend on business investment.\"\nAnd on that score, there's cause for concern, if not outright agita. Most worrying are early signs of a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on corporate lending. If that continues, the recovery may not be right around the corner, as many economists are now predicting- -or if it is, it won't feel like much of one. Here's what's going on. \nSince the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, many banks have turned hypercautious. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the most comprehensive picture of banks' willingness to lend, 51% of domestic banks restricted their lending in October, up from 40% in August. Foreign banks became just as wary, and the tougher credit conditions are affecting firms of all sizes across the country. \"We've become more conservative in our lending,\" admits George Andrews, president of Capitol City Bank & Trust in Atlanta. \"We're turning down customers we would have lent to a year ago.\" \nBanks are making it tougher for business to borrow in other ways too. According to the same Fed survey, more than half of domestic banks in October raised the rate they charge on riskier corporate loans. At the same time, a growing number of banks have imposed more stringent loan covenants and collateral requirements on large and medium-sized companies. All this took place even as the Fed was slashing short-term interest rates to stimulate business investment. Indeed, as we'll see later, what should be one of the best times ever to borrow money isn't turning out that way at all for most companies. There's one notable exception--large, well-known firms have taken advantage of a bonanza in the corporate bond market--yet here, too, that borrowing window seems to be closing as the market for commercial paper, for example, has dried up. \nSo what's making banks so jittery? Blame Osama. Jay Sidhu, CEO of Sovereign Bank in Pennsylvania, says Sept. 11 introduced a lot more uncertainty for corporate earnings, leading banks to worry about the quality of loans. \"Suddenly a firm that expected sales of X was not going to achieve that, and it made us more cautious,\" he explains. \"I think the majority of banks reacted in the same way.\" Now Sidhu is looking for tangible improvement in the economy before he's willing to lend freely. In particular, he's closely watching consumer confidence, employment, and investment in technology for signs of a sustained rebound. \nOnce Sidhu becomes less squeamish, other bankers probably won't be far behind. \"Bankers are herdlike in their behavior,\" says Zandi. \"They've trained in the same way, go to the same conferences, and talk to one another, so when one bank makes a change, the others follow.\" The trouble is, even when banks become more optimistic, there's a lag effect before easier credit benefits the economy. Researchers at the New York Fed have found that it can take at least three months from the time banks increase the availability of credit to when firms spend the funds. \nSo how bad could it get? Think back to the last time banks lost their nerve--the early 1990s. Although it's hard to remember anything negative happening at all during the 1990s nirvana, we did experience a full-blown credit crunch at the start of the decade. That's the reason the recovery from the 1990-91 recession felt so lackluster. In fact, the media dubbed it the \"jobless recovery\" because firms simply couldn't get the funds they needed from banks to expand operations and hire more staff. At the time, remember, banks were saddled with bad loans following a commercial property bust. Happily, that's not the case today. \"Right now we don't have anything like the real estate crisis of the late '80s,\" says Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist. \"It's not about a problem with capital but with confidence.\" Still, another corporate collapse a la Enron, and banks might find their capital base isn't as strong as they thought. That's one of the things about economic slumps. Loan quality can deteriorate virtually overnight. \nWhile we may well avoid a Grade A credit crunch this recession, it's clear we won't return to the days of easy money that financed the boom of the '90s anytime soon. The main reason is that the conditions for business investment aren't nearly as ideal as they were in the 1990s. As the recovery got under way back then, Washington was reducing the federal budget deficit, which brought long-term interest rates down steadily. Today we face the opposite situation. The surplus has vanished, and the prospect of mounting deficits is fast becoming reality. That's one reason long-term interest rates have hardly budged this year although official short- term rates plunged from 6.5% to 2%. Since Greenspan started cutting rates in January, 30-year bond yields have edged down from 5.5% to a mere 5.35%, and ten-year yields went from 5.31% to 5%. \nWhile the talk on Wall Street is all about recovery, with markets staging a dramatic rally since their post-Sept. 11 lows, the business environment remains grim--profit margins are at 19-year lows, there's excess capacity at every turn, and aggressive price discounting is rampant. Not exactly the best combination to encourage firms to invest now, is it? And that's reflected in the latest figures, which show that the steep decline in business investment that began a year ago is continuing today. Real business spending on plant and equipment dropped 11.9% in the third quarter, and new orders for capital goods in November suggest a further sharp drop for the fourth quarter. \"Both leading indicators and current conditions point to further declines in capital spending,\" says Prudential economist Richard Rippe. \"We're expecting next year to be just as weak on an annual basis.\" \nSo are we looking at a replay of the jobless recovery? One discouraging sign: The unemployment rate climbed to 5.7% in November, up from 5.4% the previous month. But that doesn't mean all is lost. After all, the anemic recovery at the start of the 1990s was followed by some pretty good times. \nFEEDBACK: abernasek@fortunemail.com\n\nCOLOR ILLUSTRATION: ILLUSTRATION BY ALISON SEIFFER TWO COLOR CHARTS: FORTUNE CHARTS/SOURCE: FEDERAL RESERVE Bank loans: more expensive and tougher to get Before Sept. 11, credit conditions were becoming easier for business.

But not as much as a default by Argentina would.\nNelson D. Schwartz\n\n12/24/2001\nFortune Magazine \nTime Inc. \n71\n(Copyright 2001) \n\nIn a bland suburban office park 30 minutes north of Atlanta, life after Enron is taking shape. It's a show of creative destruction that would make philosopher Joseph Schumpeter proud. Only a few months ago, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was battling Enron for a slice of the online energy market. Now ICE and its CEO, Jeff Sprecher, are struggling to handle a flood of new business, as former Enron clients search for other ways to trade electricity and natural gas. Sprecher has airlifted in servers from around the country; his tech team is working 24/7 to accommodate trading volume of $2.5 billion a day--a 100% increase in two weeks. ICE's volumes climbed steadily all through November, as Enron's customers ebbed away. But now, says Sprecher, \"by any measure, our business is going through the roof. Enron opened the door, and I walked through.\" \nICE's success at profiting from Enron's failure illustrates just how quickly the market has moved to absorb the demise of America's seventh-largest corporation. It's not that people aren't hurting: Thousands of Enron workers are unemployed, and investors face billions of dollars in losses. Still, not a single light flickered after Enron's implosion, which had almost no impact on volatile energy prices. \"It's like a great ship going down--there's a big splash, but the sea quickly fills in,\" says John Rowe, co-CEO of Exelon, the nation's ninth-largest utility. \"The short-term effect is really not that substantial.\"\nAmong energy companies that traded with Enron, potential losses range from $100 million for Duke to $80 million for Mirant and $75 million for Dynegy. Among banks, J.P. Morgan Chase recently announced that it had $500 million in unsecured loan and derivative exposure to Enron; analysts say Citigroup could face a similar loss. Those numbers sound large, but they're unlikely to cause more than a crimp in earnings. \"The fallout is a mile wide and an inch deep,\" says Jim Hanbury, a bank analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. \"One of the very good things about being a big company is that when bad things happen, it doesn't kill you.\" Indeed, the potential default of Argentina--a story pushed off the front pages by Enron--could actually pose a more serious threat to America's money-center banks. \nLarge banks are further cushioned from Enron's failure because of the way loans are syndicated. \"Literally thousands of institutions get a piece,\" says Hanbury--from smaller banks and Wall Street firms to insurance companies and hedge funds. That dilutes the impact of any one failure. Goldman Sachs' Richard Strauss says Enron's collapse could trim Citigroup's earnings by five cents a share, but he still expects Citi to earn $3.25 a share in 2002. He predicts J.P. Morgan will take a slightly bigger hit--15 cents a share--equivalent to a 4% reduction in earnings next year. Strauss is similarly sanguine about the impact on Wall Street. \"Wall Street has had time to react, so I think the exposure of major firms is pretty minimal,\" he says. \"Unlike Long-Term Capital's collapse or Russia's failure in 1998, people had a chance to unwind their trading positions this time.\" \nThe fallout is likely to be felt most keenly within the energy industry itself, especially among companies that, like Enron, had moved aggressively to profit from trading and marketing electricity and natural gas. On Wall Street and in the boardrooms of energy towns like Houston and Atlanta, there's a fierce debate over whether Enron's flaws were unique. The major surviving energy traders-- including American Electric Power, Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, and Reliant- -argue that unlike Enron, they possess major physical assets like power plants and storage facilities that balance the risks inherent in trading. \nIronically, just a year ago those companies emphasized their trading prowess; today the spin is that trading is merely a way to maximize the value of hard assets. \"Our business model is fundamentally different from Enron's,\" says Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom. \"We don't do nearly the volume of trading Enron did, and we also produce power and control natural gas. Enron had gotten out of the energy business and was essentially a financial services company that happened to make markets in electricity and natural gas.\" Even so, Dynegy faces more risk than its competitors. For starters, says CSFB analyst Curt Launer, Dynegy derives more of its earnings and cash flow from marketing and trading than do companies that are more akin to traditional utilities. In addition, Enron is suing Dynegy for $10 billion as a result of the failed merger. Although the suit has little chance of succeeding, any adverse legal decisions would immediately push Dynegy's stock price down. On the other hand, says Launer, Dynegy's shares have more upside potential if and when the energy sector comes back into favor. \nMirant's CFO Ray Hill is especially eager to put some daylight between his company and Enron. \"We have $22 billion in assets and 15,000 megawatts of generating power across the country,\" he says. \"One wall of our trading floor shows the status of every plant, and almost all our trading is driven by our own assets. So if I sell power forward six months or a year, I can produce it if I need to.\" In addition, says Hill, Mirant's internal controls bar traders from putting more than $75 million of capital at risk each day. That's a small fraction of Mirant's shareholder equity, currently $4.7 billion, or its annual profits, projected to be nearly $700 million in 2001. \"At the end of every day, the CEO and I both get a report showing exactly how much capital is at risk,\" Hill says. \nStill, executives from Mirant and other companies are taking great pains to tell investors just how their businesses work. Last month Mirant CEO Marce Fuller spent an hour and a half taking analysts in Atlanta and New York through each line of Mirant's balance sheet. \"This isn't a topic that would have been included in an analysts' meeting in the past, but there's going to be a lot more pressure on companies like ourselves to help people understand how we make money,\" says Fuller. Duke Energy's group president of energy services, Harvey Padewer, agrees: \"We've been very open with the Street. No one ever considered Duke a black box.\" \nIt will be a while before energy trading companies--even those with substantial assets--regain the trust they had before the Enron debacle. Fuller says that while Mirant has already signed several profitable deals to sell gas for former Enron clients, getting fresh capital to build new power plants or make acquisitions is much harder than it was six months ago. That has caused Mirant to slow capital expenditures and delay some new investments. \"There's still a lot of nervousness that something else is out there,\" admits Fuller. \"Larger, sophisticated players with real assets like Mirant, Dynegy, and Reliant will do just fine. But the capital markets think if Enron can go down, who else has problems?\" \nFEEDBACK: nschwartz@fortunemail.com \nSharing the Pain \nThese numbers look bad, but they're unlikely to have a big impact on earnings. \nPotential Enron Company exposure (in millions) J.P.

Investors decided it was the best thing since (or on) sliced bread: Smucker stock has risen 36% since the deal was announced. Fried PB&Js for everybody!\nWorst: HP and Compaq It's bold (the new Hewlett-Packard would be the No. 1 player in servers and PCs). It's big (it would be an $87 billion company). But is it beautiful? Some important shareholders don't think so--namely, Hewlett and Packard. The sons of the co- founders have blasted the proposed $23 billion acquisition of rival Compaq for months. We can see why: Revenues won't grow until 2003, and the much hyped $2.5 billion in cost savings won't be realized until 2004. \"We can pull this off,\" insists HP CEO Carly Fiorina. Maybe--but with seven operating systems and five processors to sort through, the details will be devilish. \nBusiness book \nBest: Fast Food Nation Eric Schlosser's immensely readable mixture of cultural history and muckraking journalism shows the big business of burgers and fries to be a \"revolutionary force in American life.\" This supersized dose of perspective on what's involved in allowing you to \"have it your way\" makes you think twice about having it at all. \nWorst: DotCom Divas Elizabeth Carlassare's collection of case studies profiling sisters doin' it for themselves with IPOs and new distribution channels would have felt \"last year\" last year. Apparently neither Carlassare nor the nearly two dozen visionaries celebrated in the book saw the dot-bomb coming. Right, Candice Carpenter? \nBusiness movie \nBest: Startup.com Ambition, betrayal, shattered friendships, and broken hearts--now, that is what business is really all about! An insightful documentary chronicling the rise and fall of the nascent dot-com GovWorks, the film perfectly captured what it was like to be in the trenches during the late, great Net boom. \nWorst: Antitrust Sure, Tim Robbins made a decent Bill Gates body double, but the MGM-backed movie's hackneyed plot about a megalomaniacal software titan intent on dominating the world's communications networks through a conspiracy of theft and murder needed serious debugging. For a real antitrust thriller, try the court transcripts of U.S. v. Microsoft. \nDresser \nBest: Bernard Arnault He earned his nickname--the \"Pope of Fashion\"--for the immense power he holds as CEO of French luxury juggernaut LVMH. But it applies equally well to his appearance. With brands like Louis Vuitton and Thomas Pink in his stable, the French billionaire always has something stunningly smart to wear. The key to looking cool, though, is never getting ruffled. Case in point: After losing a two-year battle for control of Gucci in September, Arnault turned around in November and completed a deal to acquire Donna Karan. Looking good! \nWorst: Steve Ballmer Clothes haven't made this man. In the Microsoft CEO's closet, the ex-jock and computer-geek worlds collide, and the result isn't pretty. Hey, Steve, \"bespoke\" isn't a command in Basic! You'd think $15 billion could at least buy him a decent iron. But with the antitrust case (mostly) behind him, XP on the market, and the Xbox ready to go under a bunch of Christmas trees, maybe he figures disheveled is in the eye of the beholder. \nMarketing campaign \nBest: Volkswagen People the world over are now on the lookout for colorful Beetles--\"Hey, there's a blue one!\"--thanks to Volkswagen's stylish print and TV ads. The company was named advertiser of the year by The Gunn Report, a publication that tracks global advertising awards. VW's ads aren't just fun to look at--they're effective too. The company sold more cars in the U.S. this year than at any time since 1973. \nWorst: Sony Pictures Film critic David Manning, of Connecticut's Ridgefield Press, loved Hollow Man. He raved about A Knight's Tale. And he called The Animal a winner. Too bad Manning didn't exist. A couple of Sony Pictures execs invented the man and his blurbs in order to hype Sony flicks. Two thumbs down. \nE-mail \nBest: Ted Waitt \"Hi. That's right. It's me. I'm back.\" With that simple message to Gateway's employees, the beloved 38-year-old PC company founder (above) announced his return as CEO after a yearlong absence. Some straight talk from their cowboy-boot-wearing, ponytailed leader boosted workers after months of watching profits (the company lost $94 million in the first quarter) and the stock price plunge. Too bad investors have yet to share the enthusiasm. \nWorst: Neal Patterson Enraged to see the corporate parking lot of Kansas City health-care software company Cerner empty at 7:30 one March morning, CEO Patterson fired off a blistering e-mail to company managers threatening to fire loafers and stop approving employee benefits. \"Hell will freeze over\" before he tolerates a less than \"substantially full\" lot at 7:30 a.m. again, he wrote. \"You have two weeks. Tick, tock.\" A week later the e-mail was all over the Web, prompting Cerner's stock price to sink 22% in three days. \nIPO timing \nBest: Weight Watchers As comfort-seeking Americans stuffed themselves with junk food after Sept. 11--and news of Taliban defeats invigorated the market--underwriters for the Woodbury, N.Y., weight- loss specialist were able to raise the price for Weight Watchers' mid- November IPO by 9% at the last minute. Bargain-starved investors gobbled up shares of the business (endorsed by Fergie), driving shares up 23% the first day and fattening the company's wallet by $417 million. \nWorst: Prada The Milan fashion conglomerate planned an offering on the Italian market for this summer. But the weak economy caused Prada to delay till the fall; Sept. 11 caused another postponement, this time indefinitely. That was bad news for CEO Patrizio Bertelli, husband of designer Miuccia Prada, whose recent haute couture shopping spree has him struggling to pay off some very unfashionable debt. He was recently forced to unload his 25% stake in Italian fashion house Fendi. \nCandor \nBest: Procter & Gamble The George Washington of business this year, P&G couldn't tell a lie. It admitted to rival Unilever, unprompted, that it had hired spies to gather information on Unilever's shampoo business. The P&G snoops even rooted around in Unilever's trash. When P&G CEO John Pepper learned of the operation, he fired the three executives who had authorized it and began talks with Unilever, ultimately paying about $10 million and pledging never to use any of the information gained from its spies. \nWorst: Enron Let's see: Undisclosed transactions with funds controlled, at least in part, by CFO Andrew Fastow. Misstated earnings of more than $580 million going back to 1997. Some $1.2 billion in shareholder equity vanished. Oh, and as much as $27 billion in debt that appeared nowhere on its balance sheet. One could argue that if Enron had been more candid about how it made money, it might not have ended up as the largest corporate failure in U.S. history. Of course, if Enron had been forthcoming, it wouldn't have been Enron. \nPrediction \nBest: Stanley Roach The Morgan Stanley chief economist began warning of a 2001 recession way back in September 2000--well before any of his Wall Street colleagues. \nWorst: John Chambers Where's that 30% to 50% growth you were so fond of talking about, John? Cisco's pro forma earnings per share declined by 23% this year--and that's excluding all the write-offs for unsold inventory and bad investments that you'd rather investors ignore. The only Cisco number that's even close to 50% is the decline in the company's stock, which fell from around $38 in January to near $20 in early December. \nFamily values \nBest: Rupert Murdoch Promoting your kid is one thing; sticking by him when he screws up is another. But that's just what Murdoch (above right) has done. The News Corp. CEO named eldest son Lachlan, 30 (above left), deputy chief operating officer last October. This year Lachlan lost millions of Dad's money when telecom startup OneTel, in which he'd invested the dough, went bankrupt. However, Rupert has continued to show faith in his son's business acumen; Lachlan has been busy shuffling executives in Australia and installing a new editor at the New York Post. \nWorst: Florence Fang No one likes to be fired, especially after less than a year on the job. But imagine how Ted Fang felt when, following a rocky start, he was ousted as publisher of the San Francisco Examiner by his own mother. (We also hear Fang is grounded.) \nHonorable mention: Jack Smith The General Motors CEO (above left) helped push out his little brother Mike (above right) as chairman of GM subsidiary Hughes Electronics in order to pave the way for its sale. \nLayoff policy \nBest: Charles Schwab Maybe there's no such thing as a good layoff. But at least the once fast-growing discount broker made an effort. Before chopping heads, founder Charles Schwab and his co-CEO each took a 50% pay cut; 750 other execs took cuts too, and the firm encouraged employees to take Fridays off without pay. Only after those measures failed did Schwab lay off 3,400 workers, in late March, softening the blow with 60 days' notice, stock-option grants, education stipends, and a promise to pay a $7,500 bonus to any employee who returned within 18 months. \nWorst: The airlines Ever wonder why airline workers always seem to be on strike? Just days after the Sept. 11 hijackings, even as they were securing a $15 billion bailout from Congress, the airlines announced plans to lay off an estimated 100,000 people. Three major carriers--American (20,000 job cuts), Delta (13,000), and Northwest (10,000)--invoked a force majeure clause claiming that emergency circumstances allowed them to bypass customary notice, severance, and early-retirement incentives; they later backed off a bit in the face of public opinion. \nGraceful exit \nBest: Herb Kelleher The retirement of the Southwest founder and CEO this year was as smooth as a three-point landing. Kelleher (right) leaves behind a cash-rich carrier that's well positioned to weather the problems battering the airline industry. Southwest, which refused to slash schedules after Sept. 11, was the only U.S. airline to report a profit in the third quarter. \nWorst: Linda Wachner Booted without severance after 15 years as CEO of Warnaco, Wachner leaves behind a company in desperate need of a turnaround. Thanks in part to Wachner's bloated compensation package, the women's apparel maker is bankrupt, and its stock, once worth $44, trades for pennies. Not only did Wachner let down shareholders, but she also did a stellar job of alienating key customers--most notably Calvin Klein, who called her a \"cancer\" on his brand. But Wachner isn't leaving quietly: She's considering suing Warnaco for the golden parachute--reportedly worth $44 million-- promised in her employment contract.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY DAVID BASHAW COLOR PHOTO: SCOTT THODE COLOR PHOTO COLOR PHOTO: JOANNE CHAN Ballmer (right) knows software, but he could stand some advice from Arnault (left) on ready-to-wear.

Now he's got the spotlight to himself.\nNeil Weinberg and Daniel Fisher\n\n12/24/2001\nForbes Magazine \n52\nCopyright 2001 Forbes Inc. \n\nOn a cool day in Houston early last month, Dynegy chief Charles Watson announced the boldest deal of his career. In 15 years he had built the natural-gas producer into a powerhouse, but he chafed in the shadow of his far bigger hometown rival, Enron Corp., and its chairman, the silver-tongued Kenneth Lay. Lay's swagger personified the freewheeling energy-trading markets, and Enron dominated the action, but now the titan was reeling from allegations of dirty self-dealing, a raft of sudden resignations and an SEC investigation. Valued at $70 billion only months before, Enron was teetering on the brink of collapse. \nSo Chuck Watson declared he would rescue his rival, at an especially sweet price: just $9 billion in Dynegy stock. Watson was sure the skeptics on Enron were wrong and that with a few problems solved Enron was still a rock-solid money machine. Its revenue grew 57% in the third quarter to $47 billion--more than one and a half times what Dynegy generated in all of 2000. For a fire-sale price, he boasted, Dynegy would suddenly expand sixfold into a $200 billion-a-year giant with $90 billion in assets. The supercharged firm would handle as much as one-quarter of U.S. energy trading. After operating in obscurity for years, Dynegy suddenly would become the second-largest corporation in America in sales--\"a world-class energy merchant by anyone's definition,\" Watson proclaimed.\nTwo weeks later Watson's triumph ended in epic failure. He scuttled his dream deal after getting surprised by a string of horrifying financial revelations at Enron. The big rival's market cap had continued to plunge, falling to a level so low--less than $270 million--as to make Watson look like a sucker for ever offering $9 billion. Enron clearly was headed for Chapter 11, or even liquidation. The merger was off, and the recriminations and lawsuits were just beginning. \n\"I was very disappointed,\" Watson says in characteristic, laconic understatement. He also was furious: Enron had tumbled into turmoil by misleading investors, and now it was misrepresenting its finances yet again--so says Watson--and laying the blame on Dynegy. \"I just hope the other side doesn't think all this spinning, which got them into trouble to begin with, is going to get them out of it,\" he fumes. \nIn the fallout, Enron struggles to stay alive, and Watson can count his blessings. In retreating, he has dodged Enron's $12 billion in debt, the dark cloud of the investigation now under way by the Securities & Exchange Commission, the devastated trading floor and a thicket of lawsuits and liabilities so massive and murky that they could end up burying everyone in sight. Instead, Watson is setting up the next chapter at Dynegy. He took it over in 1985 with a $600 investment and a 10% stake for himself, building it into a firm with a $10 billion market value (as of Nov. 30). With 5% now he's worth half a billion. \nWatson vows to make Dynegy even bigger, even better, and an undisputed leader in a gun-shy industry that has lost the stability and swagger of its once-dominant progenitor, Enron. Dynegy says it can grow at least 20% next year, to $35 billion in revenue. \nThe death of Enron is a mixed blessing for Chuck Watson. Some of Enron's business and some of its brightest people will wind up at his firm; if he gets his way in court Watson will also get Enron's valuable pipeline system, Northern Natural Gas, in return for the $1.5 billion he poured into Enron in the course of the merger plans. The negative: litigation. Enron is threatening to sue Dynegy for backing out of the merger, and Enron's creditors are sure to pile on at some point. \nEven without swallowing the bigger Enron, Dynegy is a leading processor of natural gas and one of the top three transporters on every interstate pipeline in North America. Its power plants generate 19,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 8 million. In the commodity derivatives markets, where suppliers and utilities lock in future prices, Dynegy is a top trader in natural gas, power, coal, emission credits and weather derivatives. But these volatile trading businesses, which contributed 80% of Enron's alleged earnings but ultimately could not make up for its blunders elsewhere, are merely a healthy sideline at Dynegy, contributing only 20% of earnings. \nAnd Watson may yet have a multibillion-dollar merger in his future. Big rivals such as American Electric Power, Duke Energy and Reliant outmuscle Dynegy in some markets, making them attractive partners. He expresses keen interest in doing more deals, having made nine acquisitions since 1995, which has kept Dynegy's top line growing a hefty 45% a year. Last year its stock jumped 218%, the second-best performance in the S&P 500. Even on the day Watson bailed out of buying Enron, he inked a $600 million purchase of another outfit, BG Storage. He's a gambler whose winning streak might not have ended. \nEnron and Dynegy were born the same year--1985--but took very different paths. Ken Lay started out with $10 billion in revenues from the merger of two energy companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Then he won fame and accolades for transforming a stodgy old gas business into a sexy wheeler-dealer, doing for energy what Nasdaq did for stocks: creating a highly liquid, over-the-counter market for all kinds of contracts. In the process, he slapped Enron's name on a new sports stadium and hobnobbed with the likes of Dick Cheney and George W. Bush. \nChuck Watson started out with far less. Dynegy began life under the unpromising name of the U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a marketing arm jointly owned by six pipeline companies, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Akin Gump. Nor was Watson some headhunter's superstar: He began his career as a lowly trainee at Conoco. Even after Dynegy hit the big leagues, Watson's aw-shucks manner kept him out of the public eye; he frequently says he'd rather let his customers talk up Dynegy than do it himself. Flashy, no, but competitive, hell yes: He is so fierce a warrior on the links that when he was recovering from an Achilles tendon injury recently, he borrowed an oversize golf shoe to fit it over his sore, swollen foot rather than miss combat in 18 holes. \nAlways scrappy and still athletic at 51, Watson was born in Great Lakes, Ill., one of four children of a salesman who hawked space in industrial parks. The family moved around a lot and Watson attended 22 schools in nine states. Sports let him fit in quickly. He was driving for a college basketball scholarship until he seriously injured his back in a car wreck as a high school senior in Ft. Smith, Ark. On graduating from Oklahoma State in 1972, he took a job with Conoco in Ponca City, Okla. so he could stay close to his college sweetheart, Kim, who now has been married to him for 28 years. The summer job turned full-time, and in the next 12 years Watson worked his way up at Conoco to the middling title of sales director. \nIt was 1984, natural gas was on the verge of revolution, and Watson wanted to be in the vanguard. \"A lot of people in this business were scared by deregulation,\" he recalls. \"I was excited by the opportunities.\" Opportunity arrived in the form of the slapped-together U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse. \nWatson first turned down the job. It looked unworkable. The pipeline companies might try to force the fledgling firm to do business only with their own pipelines; how would he push them aside? His suitors kept wooing him, offering a sizable raise, and finally Watson relented, with one condition: \"Don't pay me a salary--give me 10% of the company.\" He got both, the equity initially taking the form of phantom stock--in effect, a long-term option. \nOn Watson's first day on the job, only 6 of the 60 employees borrowed from the parent firms showed up. He told the no-shows not to come back. Later that year he bought out the 10% stakes from the pipelines for $100 each and then he got Akin Gump to sell, leaving Morgan as sole shareholder. His vision was clear from day one. Hundreds of brokers were jumping in, many armed with just a phone and a Rolodex. Competing with them was a losing game. Suppliers and buyers would eventually get each other's phone numbers, and one day the fat middleman spreads that Watson's shop relied on would evaporate. Then what? \nWith the backing of Morgan Stanley and a surfeit of underground salt domes for gas storage, Watson figured he could buy gas at wellheads and deliver it when and where customers wanted, holding it for them when they didn't need it and serving it up when demand surged. This meant Watson would assume the risk of holding gas that might tumble in price; but any trader could handle that risk with some artful hedges. \nThe startup was barely making payroll when Watson arrived, turning a sale a week and celebrating each with a round of cigars. Watson nixed the cigars and started turning multiple sales a day. He worked his contacts and had staff cold-calling corporate gas users to drum up business. \nBy 1989 Morgan Stanley wanted out and sold the company for $16 million. The buyers were three energy companies (British Gas, Nova and Chevron) and employees. Morgan was happy with its tidy profit. Had it held on, its stake would be worth $10 billion. \nMeanwhile Ken Lay at Enron was discovering the same potential in gas trading. Deregulation had left producers and utilities at the mercy of volatile spot prices. Lay began writing long-term contracts to buy or sell gas at fixed prices. Business grew more stable at both ends of the pipeline. Eventually the raw trading of these contracts--rather than delivering on them--became Enron's mainstay. \nIn the mid-1990s electricity joined gas on the deregulatory path. Watson wanted in but needed currency. So in 1995 he bought Trident, a publicly held ethylene producer; the reverse merger gave him new access to money in the capital markets. The following fall, Watson cut a deal with Chevron to sell the oil giant's entire North American gas output, the first such exclusive marketing deal. It was precisely what Watson had in mind all along. The gas producer receives market prices at its wells. Watson takes ownership, transports, stores and delivers the energy at a markup. He compares the approach to that of grain trader Cargill. \nBusiness was booming, but Watson wanted to buy a lot more gas processing plants and electric power plants. The problem was in raising the cash. Dynegy had a public currency, but 88% was now in the hands of employees and three institutions. There wasn't enough of a float to attract institutional shareholders. So Watson walked into a meeting of his owners in Scotland in 1997 with a blunt message: \"We have a problem. It's in this room. Two of you have to go. I don't care which.\" Then he walked out. Nova and British Gas exited. The company's float went to 60% overnight. The next year Watson changed Natural Gas Clearinghouse's name to Dynegy, excising an \"r\" to dodge a preexisting British claim. Then he used his stock to make his boldest push yet into power. Illinova, an Illinois generating firm, was nearly insolvent. Watson bought it for a pittance. \nEnron was having a field day with deregulation, too. Instead of buying electricity from a plant and selling it elsewhere for a tiny cut, it began carving output into pieces, much as Wall Street slices Treasurys into Treasury strips. Enron would guarantee a utility running a distribution grid all the power it would need on a hot summer afternoon. An aluminum smelter would pay half as much but suffer some interruptions. \nAs Enron's confidence grew, its trades got more exotic, involving derivatives on pulp, metals, pollution and the weather. In late 1999 the firm shifted much of its business to EnronOnline, basking in the dot-com craze. The site soon was handling $3 billion in trades daily. Revenues in 2000 doubled to $101 billion. Reported earnings before interest and taxes hit $2.3 billion. At a January 2001 analyst meeting, company execs suggested Enron's price of $80 a share was inadequate, notwithstanding that it was 46 times earnings. The shares should have been going for $126, said President Jeffrey Skilling. \nBy then Enron and Dynegy had gone separate ways. Enron was selling assets, earning 80% of its profits from trading and 20% from energy. At Dynegy the ratios were reversed. In February Lay handed the top job to Skilling, chief advocate of Enron's asset-lite strategy. Lay became elder statesman. \nSkilling epitomized Enron's hubris. He had once said of a rival, \"If Thomas Alva Edison came back from the dead and called Southern Co. he'd find nothing has changed.\" Of Enron: \"We're on the side of angels. People want open, competitive markets .... It's the American way.\" To goose earnings, Skilling set up outside partnerships. They, in turn, issued Enron-backed bonds and used the proceeds to buy power plants, fiber optics and other assets from Enron. Then Enron plowed the cash into its trading business while the debt--and losses--moved off its books. \nThe questions started getting prickly when Enron's stock price fell in the spring. Its business of trading fiber-optic capacity, with revenues of more than $300 million in 2000, lost $137 million in the first half of 2001 as sales plunged. In mid-August Skilling abruptly quit. Speculation was that something was seriously amiss. Then on Oct. 16 Enron set a $1 billion third-quarter charge related to a partnership linked to Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, plus a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity due to \"accounting errors.\" Rumors were rampant that trading partners were avoiding Enron and that it was on the brink of a credit downgrade that would force it to immediately repay $3.9 billion in debt, pushing it into bankruptcy. \nOn Oct. 25, Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom was invited to lunch by Stanley Horton, chief of Enron's pipeline group. Horton--without first telling Ken Lay of his plans--told Bergstrom that Enron was in deep trouble and that a merger with Dynegy was the best way out. But it had to happen fast. \nEnron's desperate plea in hand, Bergstrom called Watson, who was outside an operating room in St. Louis where his mother was having heart surgery. \"I was intrigued and honored they had come to us,\" Watson recalls. He set one demand: Ken Lay had to call him personally. Lay called him the next day, and on Saturday morning Watson and Lay chewed over a deal in Lay's kitchen. Watson offered a deal with no premium over Enron's depressed price. Lay accepted and said he would step aside. \nDynegy was an obvious mate. The firms are right across the street from each other, and many employees have worked at both. Their traders live in the same neighborhoods--the Young Turks in West University and the superstars in River Oaks. They send their kids to ritzy St. John's School. \"The press loves the rivalry between Enron and Dynegy, but on a lot of issues, we're on the same page,\" Bergstrom says. \nFor Dynegy, Enron's crunch was sweet revenge. Dynegy execs chafed at the the dowdy image they were accorded despite fast growth and a soaring stock. Lay put Enron's name on Houston's new baseball stadium. Watson bragged about his small p.r. staff. A media search yields 91,000 mentions of Enron in five years--six times as many as for Dynegy. \nFor all their folksiness, Dynegy execs were talking trash about Enron for years. Off the record, they questioned Enron's assertions it held \"balanced books\" of commitments to buy and sell commodities and suggested their rival was laying risky bets on the direction of gas and electricity prices. \nInvestment bankers came in to do the paperwork. Dynegy merger chief Hugh Tarpley, an alum of Notre Dame, coined the de rigeur code names: Dynegy was the heroic Rockne; Enron, fittingly, was the Gipper--the dying football player. Watson, meanwhile, was hosting a week-long pro-am golf tournament for 300 clients, one of his first forays into big-time promotion. Some events he couldn't miss, like a round of golf with Tiger Woods. When guests asked where he was, underlings made excuses. On the last day of the tournament, someone noticed Watson heading toward the course in a golf cart wearing business shoes, a clue that he was headed for merger talks; he feigned forgetfulness. \nChief Financial Officer Robert Doty, meanwhile, was poring over Enron's financials and feeling fine. \"We got a lot of comfort that the core business was operating well and capable of generating great cash flow,\" Doty recalls. But ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, scrutinized the deal and asked--why not wait for Enron to fall into bankruptcy and buy it at a distress sale? In the end Chevron put $1.5 billion into Dynegy, which used it to buy 100% of the preferred stock in the Enron unit that owns its prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline. That, along with $1 billion more at the merger's close, was expected to give Enron the liquidity it needed. \nWatson unveiled his daring rescue plan on Friday, Nov. 9, reserving the right to call off the deal if Enron's liabilities rose, or profits fell, below certain levels. His hole card: a clause stating Dynegy's $1.5 billion investment gave it the right to keep the big pipeline even if the deal was aborted. \"There was a lot we didn't know,\" he admits, \"but we thought we'd adequately protected our shareholders.\" Dynegy's stock had a quick 28% run-up on news of the bid. \nIf Skilling is to go down in history books for his hubris, Watson should get a mention, too. J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup offered to inject $500 million or more in equity capital into Enron. Watson, confident that Enron's hemorrhaging was over, brushed aside the offer. \nThe euphoria faded fast. On Nov. 19 Enron filed quarterly financials that held two bombshells. Recent credit downgrades to a notch above junk had put Enron on the hook to repay $690 million to a partnership in just a week--something Enron had never warned Dynegy about. What's more, Enron had $1 billion less in cash on hand than it was supposed to have. \nWatson was stunned. Enron had provided a peek at the numbers two weeks before, but none of this was disclosed (Enron has disputed this). Watson says that Dynegy got the full filing just three hours before it was made public and that only then did he know his deal was in trouble. What else had Enron failed to disclose? Negotiations went on even as Enron shares fell to $4 and lower. On Nov. 28 three credit agencies downgraded Enron to junk status. That morning Watson called Lay and killed the deal. Lay was cordial. \nThe niceties ended there. Dynegy issued a press release staking its claim to Northern Natural Gas and accusing Enron of misrepresentation. Enron's chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, disputed that claim and said Dynegy saw the financials in advance, hinting Dynegy may owe Enron a $350 million breakup fee. Bunk, says Watson: \"It's real cute for Jeff to say we got an advance copy when it was 110 pages we received just three hours in advance.\" \nEven if Dynegy's biggest deal slipped through Watson's fingers there is a big world of opportunities in energy. In Europe, Dynegy has a growing presence and can play the same games it did in the U.S. as the energy industry there deregulates. \nBack at home, Watson confronts months of legal wrangling and a long struggle to reclaim legitimacy for the energy-trading business. The recent chaos in California and the collapse of Enron will make further deregulation--and Dynegy's stock--a tough sale. \nAdditional reporting by Rob Wherry.\n\n..................................................................................................................................... \n\nBusiness Week International Editions: American News: THE FALL OF ENRON\nAFTERSHOCKS IN EUROPE Enron's collapse will hit many markets\nBy David Fairlamb in Paris\n\n12/17/2001\nBusinessWeek \n38\n(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.) \n\nEnron Corp. may be based in Houston, but its spectacular collapse has had almost as big an impact in Europe as in the U.S. The energy trader's bankruptcy has sent European banks, investors, electricity consumers, and champions of Europewide energy deregulation reeling. And it's not just the energy markets that have been thrown into confusion. Enron was active in a number of other European sectors, including metals and pulp and paper trading. It even owns a windmill manufacturer in Germany. ``This was a global company whose collapse will be felt right around the world,'' says Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredito Italiano. \nProfumo should know. Over the last year, the Milan bank loaned Enron an estimated $20 million. All told, European banks have admitted to lending Enron and its subsidiaries more than $2 billion. In addition, analysts calculate, there is up to a billion dollars further exposure in the form of derivatives and trading contracts.\nThe European bank reported to have the largest loan exposure to Enron--between $500 million and $800 million--is Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS executives aren't talking, but their stock has taken a big hit. Other banks with sizable Enron loan exposure include Britain's Abbey National, France's Credit Lyonnais, and the Netherlands' ABN Amro (table). ``Enron isn't on the same scale as the Long-Term Credit Management collapse [in 1998],'' says Peter Luxton, global economic adviser to Standard & Poor's Corp., ``but it still has a huge effect.'' \nIn recent days, the scale of that financial damage has become clearer. The result could well be tighter credit for many companies just as Europe's economy softens. Spreads in the corporate fixed income market widened by up to 40 basis points between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. Adding to the pressure is the fear that there is more risk in the credit markets than was realized. ``We didn't know Enron, but lent on the back of its credit rating,'' says Profumo. As Enron sank, he adds, ``the first question I asked my colleagues was: `What is the value of a rating?''' Just a few months ago, the parent company had an AA rating from the main agencies. It's now rated as junk. \nBanks aren't the only ones affected. Enron stock and bonds were widely held by European mutual funds and insurers. The lucky ones offloaded their stakes as the extent of the company's problems started to come out. ``I knew I had to get out in August, when they canceled a meeting with me at the last minute--after I'd arrived in Houston,'' says a fund manager at a private German bank. He quickly dumped $50 million of Enron stock. Insurers that still held big blocks of Enron shares when it collapsed include Germany's Allianz, France's AXA, and Holland's Aegon. Analysts estimate Aegon's exposure at $200 million. \nMeanwhile, Europe's spot and futures markets for electricity are in chaos. Enron was a big electricity supplier and trader in Europe, at the height of its activity accounting for up to 20% of volume traded on the energy exchanges. Most energy and power companies already had wound down their exposure to Enron by the time its collapse became imminent. But the scale of the company's problems and the speed with which it collapsed have unsettled many traders. Not surprisingly, the price of energy futures is on the way up. Because Enron's aggressive pricing had helped bring down tariffs, businesses and domestic consumers will have to pay more for their energy this winter. Prices will probably rise fastest--up to 2.5%--in Britain's deregulated market, say analysts. Enron was a particularly large player there, producing electricity and delivering it to 2.2 million retail consumers and thousands of companies. \nEven more than in the U.S., Enron's woes are likely to increase resistance to energy deregulation. Although Germany and Britain have almost wholly liberalized their markets, progress elsewhere, especially France, has been slow. Opponents of reform will use the Enron debacle to hold up the process. ``They're going to make a real meal out of this in Paris,'' says a European Commission official in Brussels. This American bankruptcy is Europe's headache.\n\nIndecent Exposure\nEurope's banks turn out to be big Enron creditors\n                              MILLION\nROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND         $500\nBritain\nINTESA-BCI                      300\nItaly\nCREDIT LYONNAIS                 250\nFrance\nABN AMRO                        200\nNetherlands\nSOCIETE GENERALE                167\nFrance\nABBEY NATIONAL                  160\nBritain\nBARCLAYS                        126\nBritain\nDEUTSCHE BANK                    50\nGermany\nData: Bank and analysts' estimates\nPhotograph: ENRON'S INTERESTS INCLUDE A GERMAN WINDMILL MAKER PHOTOGRAPH BY JENS DIETRICH/FOTOAGENTUR NETZHAUT \n..................................................................................................................................... \n\nCover Story\nTHE FALL OF ENRON How ex-CEO Jeff Skilling's strategy grew so complex that even his boss couldn't get a handle on it\nBy Wendy Zellner and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas with Emily Thornton, Peter Coy, Heather Timmons, Louis Lavelle, and David Henry in New York, and bureau reports\n\n12/17/2001\nBusinessWeek \n30\n(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.) \n\nTo former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, there were two kinds of people in the world: those who got it and those who didn't. ``It'' was Enron's complex strategy for minting rich profits and returns from a trading and risk-management business built essentially on assets owned by others. Vertically integrated behemoths like ExxonMobil Corp., whose balance sheet was rich with oil reserves, gas stations, and other assets, were dinosaurs to a contemptuous Skilling. ``In the old days, people worked for the assets,'' Skilling mused in an interview last January. ``We've turned it around--what we've said is the assets work for the people.'' \nBut who looks like Tyrannosaurus Rex now? As Enron Corp. struggles to salvage something from the nation's largest bankruptcy case, filed on Dec. 2, it's clear that the real Enron was a far cry from the nimble ``asset light'' market maker that Skilling proclaimed. And the financial maneuvering and off-balance-sheet partnerships that he and ex-Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow perfected to remove everything from telecom fiber to water companies from Enron's debt-heavy balance sheet helped spark the company's implosion. ``Jeff's theory was assets were bad, intellectual capital was good,'' says one former senior executive. Employees readily embraced the rhetoric, the executive says, but they ``didn't understand how it was funded.''\nNeither did many others. Bankers, stock analysts, auditors, and Enron's own board failed to comprehend the risks in this heavily leveraged trading giant. Enron's bankruptcy filings show $13.1 billion in debt for the parent company and an additional $18.1 billion for affiliates. But that doesn't include at least $20 billion more estimated to exist off the balance sheet. Kenneth L. Lay, 59, who had nurtured Skilling, 48, as his successor, sparked the first wave of panic when he revealed in an Oct. 16 conference call with analysts that deals involving partnerships run by his CFO would knock $1.2 billion off shareholder equity. Lay, who had been out of day-to-day management for years, was never able to clearly explain how the partnerships worked or why anyone shouldn't assume the worst--that they were set up to hide Enron's problems, inflate earnings, and personally benefit the executives who managed some of them. \nThat uncertainty ultimately scuttled Enron's best hope for a rescue: its deal to be acquired by its smaller but healthier rival, Dynegy Inc. Now Enron is frantically seeking a rock-solid banking partner to help maintain some shred of its once-mighty trading empire. Already, 4,000 Enron workers in Houston have lost their jobs. And hundreds of creditors, from banks to telecoms to construction companies, are trying to recover part of the billions they're owed. \nFrom the beginning, Lay had a vision for Enron that went far beyond that of a traditional energy company. When Lay formed Enron from the merger of two pipeline companies in 1985, he understood that deregulation of the business would offer vast new opportunities. To exploit them, he turned to Skilling, then a McKinsey & Co. consultant. Skilling was the chief nuts-and-bolts-operator from 1997 until his departure last summer, and the architect of an increasingly byzantine financial structure. After he abruptly quit in August, citing personal reasons, and his right-hand financier Fastow was ousted Oct. 24, there was no one left to explain it. \nMuch of the blame for Enron's collapse has focused on the partnerships, but the seeds of its destruction were planted well before the October surprises. According to former insiders and other sources close to Enron, it was already on shaky financial ground from a slew of bad investments, including overseas projects ranging from a water business in England to a power distributor in Brazil. ``You make enough billion-dollar mistakes, and they add up,'' says one source close to Enron's top executives. In June, Standard & Poor's analysts put the company on notice that its underperforming international assets were of growing concern. But S&P, which like BusinessWeek is a unit of The McGraw-Hill companies, ultimately reaffirmed the credit ratings, based on Enron's apparent willingness to sell assets and take other steps. \nBehind all the analyses of Enron was the assumption that the core energy business was thriving. It was still growing rapidly, but margins were inevitably coming down as the market matured. ``Once that growth slowed, any weakness would start becoming more apparent,'' says Standard & Poor's Corp. director Todd A. Shipman. ``They were not the best at watching their cost.'' Indeed, the tight risk controls that seemed to work well in the trading business apparently didn't apply to other parts of the company. \nSkilling's answer to growing competition in energy trading was to push Enron's innovative techniques into new arenas, everything from broadband to metals, steel, and even advertising time and space. Skilling knew he had to find a way to finance his big growth plans and manage the international problems without killing the company's critical investment-grade credit rating. Without a clever solution, trading partners would flee, or the cost of doing deals would become insurmountable. ``HE'S HEARTBROKEN.'' No one ever disputed that Skilling was clever. The Pittsburgh-born son of a sales manager for an Illinois valve company, he took over as production director at a startup Aurora (Ill.) TV station at age 13 when an older staffer quit and he was the only one who knew how to operate the equipment. Skilling landed a full-tuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to study engineering, but quickly changed to business. After graduation, he went to work for a Houston bank. The bank later went bust while Skilling was at Harvard Business School. Skilling said that fiasco made him determined to keep strict risk controls on Enron's trading business. He once told BusinessWeek that ``I've never not been successful in business or work, ever.'' Skilling now declines to comment, but his brother Tom, a Chicago TV weatherman, says of him: ``He's heartbroken over what's going on there.... We were not raised to look on these kinds of things absent emotion.'' \nEnron's ``intellectual capital'' was Skilling's pride and joy. He recruited more than 250 newly minted MBAs each year from the nation's top business schools. Meteorologists and PhDs in math and economics helped analyze and model the vast amounts of data that Enron used in its trading operations. A forced ranking system weeded out the poor performers. ``It was as competitive internally as it was externally,'' says one former executive. \nIt was no surprise then that Skilling would turn to a bright young finance wizard, Fastow, to help him find capital for his rapidly expanding empire. Boasting an MBA from Northwestern University, Fastow was recruited to Enron in 1990 from Continental Bank, where he worked on leveraged buyouts. Articulate, handsome, and mature beyond his years, he became Enron's CFO at age 36. In October, 1999, he earned CFO Magazine's CFO Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management. An effusive Skilling crowed to the magazine: ``We didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways.'' \nBut Skilling's fondness for the buttoned-down Fastow was not widely shared. Many colleagues considered him a prickly, even vindictive man, prone to attacking those he didn't like in Enron's group performance reviews. Fastow, through his attorney, declined to comment for this story. When he formed and took a personal stake in the LJM partnerships that blew up in October, the conflict of interest inherent in those deals only added to his colleagues' distaste for him. Enron admits Fastow earned more than $30 million from the partnerships. The Enron CFO wasn't any more popular on Wall Street, where investment bankers bristled at the finance group's ``we're smarter than you guys'' attitude. Indeed, that came back to haunt Enron when it needed capital commitments to stem the liquidity crisis. ``It's the sort of organization about which people said, `Screw them. We don't really owe them anything,''' says one investment banker. \nWhile LJM--and Fastow's direct personal involvement and enrichment--shocked many, the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Skilling and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mid-'90s to fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the balance sheet. Keeping the debt off Enron's books depended on a steady or rising stock price and an investment- grade credit rating. ``They were put together with good intentions to offset some risk,'' says S&P analyst Ron M. Barone. ``It's conceivable that it got away from them.`` \nDid it ever. The off-balance-sheet structures grew increasingly complex and risky, according to insiders and others who have studied the deals. Some, with names like Osprey, Whitewing, and Marlin, were revealed in Enron's financial filings and even rated by the big credit-rating agencies. But almost no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enron's total debt, what triggers might hasten repayment, or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder equity. ``No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come due if this company got downgraded,'' says one lender involved with Enron. Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essentially dump the debts back on Enron. In some cases, if Enron's stock fell below a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment grade--once unimaginable--nearly $4 billion in partnership debt would have to be covered by Enron. At the same time, the value of the assets in many of these partnerships was dropping, making it even harder for Enron to cover the debt. HIGH HOPES. Skilling tried to accelerate the sale of international assets after becoming chief operating officer in 1997, but the efforts were arduous and time-consuming. Even as tech stocks melted down, Skilling was determined not to scale back his grandiose broadband trading dreams or the resulting price-to-earnings multiple of almost 60 that they helped create for Enron's stock. At its peak in August, 2000, about a third of the stock's $90 price was attributable to expectations for growth of broadband trading, executives estimate. \nThat rapidly rising stock price--up 55% in '99 and 87% in 2000--gave Skilling and Fastow a hot currency for luring investors into their off-balance-sheet deals. They quickly became dependent on such deals to finance their expansion efforts. ``It was like crack,'' says a company insider. Trouble is, Enron's stock came tumbling back to earth when market valuations fell this year. By April, its price had fallen to about 55. And its far-flung operational troubles were taking their own toll. In its much-hyped broadband business, for instance, a capacity glut and financial meltdown made it hard to find creditworthy counterparties for trading. And after spending some $1.2 billion to build and operate a fiber-optic network, Enron found itself with an asset whose value was rapidly deteriorating. Even last year, company executives could see the need to cut back an operation that had 1,700 employees and a cash burn rate of $700 million a year. ``SOMETHING TO PROVE.'' And the international problems weren't going away. Enron's 65% stake in the $3 billion Dabhol power plant in India was mired in a dispute with its largest customer, which refused to pay for electricity. Some Indian politicians have despised the deal for years, claiming that cunning and even corrupt Enron executives cut a deal that charged India too much for its power. \nEnron's ill-fated 1998 investment in the water-services business was another drag on earnings. Many saw the purchase of Wessex Water in England as a ``consolation prize'' for Rebecca P. Mark, the hard-charging Enron executive who had negotiated the Dabhol deal and other investments around the world. With Skilling having won out as Lay's clear heir apparent, top executives wanted to move her out of the way, say former insiders. A narrowly split board approved the Wessex deal, which formed the core of Azurix Corp., to be run by Mark. But Enron was blindsided by British regulators who slashed the rates the utility could charge. Meanwhile, Mark piled on more high-priced water assets. ``Once [Skilling] put her there, he let her go wild,'' says a former executive. ``And she's going to go wild because she has something to prove.'' Mark spent too much on a water concession in Brazil and ran into political obstacles. She declined to comment for this story. \nBut if Azurix was a prime example of Enron's sketchy investment strategy, it also demonstrated how the company tried to disguise its problems with financial alchemy. To set up the company, Enron formed a partnership called the Atlantic Water Trust, in which it held a 50% stake. That kept Wessex off Enron's balance sheet. Enron's partner in the joint venture was Marlin Water Trust, which consisted of institutional investors. To help attract them, Enron promised to back up the debt with its own stock if necessary. But if Enron's credit rating fell below investment grade and the stock fell below a certain point, Enron could be on the hook for the partnership's $915 million in debt. \nThe end for Enron came when its murky finances and less-than-forthright disclosures spooked investors and Dynegy. The clincher came when Dynegy's bankers spent hours sifting through a supposedly final draft of Enron's about-to-be-released 10Q--only to discover two pages of damning new numbers when the quarterly statement was made publicly available. Debt coming due in the fourth quarter had leapt from under $1 billion to $2.8 billion. Even worse, cash on hand--to which Dynegy had recently contributed $1.5 billion--shrunk from $3 billion to $1.2 billion. Dynegy ``had a two-hour meeting with the new treasurer of Enron, who had been in that seat for two weeks,'' said a source close to the deal. ``He had no clue where the numbers came from.'' RESPECT FOR ASSETS. Skilling and Fastow face most of the wrath of reeling employees. ``Someone told me yesterday if they see Jeff Skilling on the street, they would scratch out his eyes,'' says a former executive. One of Fastow's lawyers, David B. Gerger, says his client has been the subject of death threats and anti-Semitic tirades in Internet chat rooms. ``Naturally people look for scapegoats, but it would be wrong to scapegoat Mr. Fastow,'' says Gerger. \nHe confirms that Fastow has hired a big gun to handle his civil litigation: David Boies's firm, which represented the Justice Dept. in its suit against Microsoft Corp. On Dec. 5, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach filed a suit against Fastow, Skilling, and 27 other Enron executives, saying they illegally made more than $1 billion off stock sales before Enron tanked. And a source at the Securities & Exchange Commission says four U.S. Attorney Offices are considering whether to pursue criminal charges against Enron and its officers. \nWould the cash squeeze have caught up to Enron, even without Skilling's and Fastow's fancy financing? Credit analysts still argue that the debt would have been manageable, absent the crisis of confidence that dried up Enron's trading business and access to the capital markets. But even they have a new respect for old-fashioned, high-quality assets. ``When things get really tough, hard assets are the kind you can depend upon,'' says S&P's Shipman. That's something Enron's whiz-kid financiers failed to appreciate.\n\nEnron's Stock Price\nDEC. 31 1996\n$21.50\nAUG. 17 2000\n$90\nDEC.5 2001\n$1.01\nData: Bloomberg Financial Markets\nSkilling's Strategy: What Went Wrong?\n         THE BIG IDEA                              THE PROBLEM\nCreate an ``asset light'' company.

Virtually all the checks and balances designed to prevent this kind of financial meltdown failed. Unless remedied, this could undermine public trust, the capital markets, and the nation's entire equity culture. Even now, no one really knows what liabilities are buried inside dozens of partnerships or the role ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling played in creating a byzantine system of off-balance-sheet operations. A culture of secrecy and a remarkable lack of transparency prevented any realistic assessment of the company's financial risk. Nothing less than an overhaul of the auditing profession is now required to police accounting standards. Wall Street, mutual funds, and the business press would also do well to rethink why each, in its own way, celebrated what is now revealed to be an arrogant, duplicitous company managed in a dangerous manner (page 30). \nWhat is increasingly clear is that Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant and Harvard Business School grad, tried to craft Enron as a new kind of virtual trading giant, operating outside the scrutiny of investors and regulators. Enron's numerous partnerships were shrouded in secrecy, tucked away off the balance sheet. They were used to shift debt and assets off the books while inflating earnings. The chief financial officer ran and partly owned two partnerships, a clear conflict of interest. Enron leveraged itself without a reality check by any outsider. ASLEEP. Hardly anyone inside the company was urging caution, certainly not chairman Ken Lay. The independent auditing committee on the board of directors was clearly asleep. Given Enron's arcane financial engineering, the committee probably relied on Arthur Andersen, the auditor, for information. But Andersen didn't blow any whistles. No surprise there. It made more money selling consulting services to Enron last year than it did auditing the company. Criticizing Enron's books might have jeopardized consulting work. Similar conflicts of interest stopped Wall Street analysts from pulling the plug on Enron. Even as Enron slid toward bankruptcy, ``buy'' recommendations were being issued by analysts whose firms were doing investment-banking business with the company, or were hoping to.\nDid anyone really know what was going on inside Enron? The rating agencies, Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, presumably had better access than average investors, but neither downgraded Enron's credit rating to below investment grade until the bitter end. The rating agencies argue that had they downgraded Enron sooner, they would have simply pushed the company into bankruptcy earlier. Here's a flash: So what? Moody's and S&P have one basic job--assessing risk for investors. If they couldn't penetrate Enron's complex financial engineering, the rating agencies should have said so. \nThe business press, including BusinessWeek, did no better. It celebrated Skilling's vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anything and trade it anywhere. The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome of a new, post-deregulation corporate model when it should have been much more aggressive in probing the company's opaque partnerships, off balance sheet maneuvers, and soaring leverage. TRAGIC. Enron's fall is made all the more tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees. Not only are many losing their jobs, but some 12,000 are also losing most of their retirement savings. In perhaps its most egregious risk-management error, employees mostly held Enron stock in their 401(k)s, yet the company prevented them from selling until they reached the age of 54. People could only watch as the stock plummeted from $89 to a dollar. Diversification, particularly in retirement accounts, is the cardinal rule in managing risk. Enron broke that rule, as have other companies. \nEnron's tale is a clarifying event. It reveals key weaknesses in the financial system that must be corrected as the U.S. moves forward in the 21st century. If America is to have an equity culture in which individuals invest in stocks and provide the capital for fast economic growth, the market must be able to correctly value companies. This requires making financial data readily available and easily comprehensible. \nTo restore public confidence, several steps should be taken. After accounting disasters at MicroStrategy, Cendant, Lucent, Cisco, and Waste Management, it is clear that self-regulation is not working. Conflicts of interest within auditing firms remain widespread. Investors can ignore analysts on TV who work for investment firms. But someone has to play the role of the honest watchdog. Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act, they will wind up with a federally chartered oversight body. It is equally clear that current standard accounting rules aren't sufficient. Loopholes allowed Enron to fool everyone, making a mockery of public disclosure. \nRegulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice in their 401(k)s. Some 30% of assets held in 1.5 million 401(k) plans are in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan. This lack of diversification puts too many people at risk. \nIn the end, the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that failed in its primary business mission: to manage risk. Had the Federal Reserve and other central banks not flooded the global economy with liquidity in recent months, Enron's collapse could have posed a deep threat to the financial markets. It's past time to fix the system.\n\nIllustration: Chart: STUNNING COLLAPSE CHART BY RON PLYMAN/BW \n..................................................................................................................................... \n\nBusiness\nDigging Into the Deal That Broke Enron; Behind the web of mysterious partnerships that led to the world's biggest corporate collapse. Follow the Raptors\nBy Allan Sloan With Debra Rosenberg in Washington and Anne Belli Gesalman in Houston. sloan is NEWSWEEK's Wall Street editor. His e-mail address is sloan@panix.com.\n\n12/17/2001\nNewsweek \n48\nCopyright (C) 2001 Newsweek Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\nEnron corp. used to talk about becoming the world's biggest company. Instead, it became the world's biggest corporate failure, filing for bankruptcy last week. The company, which used complexity to its advantage on the way up, became a victim of its own complex dealmaking on the way down. A NEWSWEEK examination of Enron's filings shows that the company's fatal mistake was an unintended byproduct of one such deal. The transaction first inflated Enron's reportednet worth, then deflated it. When the company cleaned up its books this fall, it triggered the $1.2 billion net-worth write-down that touched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy. \nEnron looked like a well-oiled machine, but a lot of it seems to have been jury-rigged. The company was housed in a spiffy 50-story building in downtown Houston, a structure whose elevators flashed Enron's latest stock price and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got to their offices. In the best New Economy tradition, Enron had an on-site health club, casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing in Enron stock.\nBut when things started going bad, Enron couldn't cope. It couldn't even fire people properly. Information-technology specialist Diana Peters says her entire department was told to clear out on half an hour's notice and to call their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next day. Very classy. \"I was crying, a lot of people were crying,\" says Peters, 51. \"It reminded me of a mass funeral.\" \nThe company even had trouble going broke. Normally, a company hoards cash in preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers and slowing down payments to vendors. Enron didn't start doing that until a few days before the filing, far too late. Enron almost became the Flying Dutchman of the bankruptcy world. It wanted to file in Wilmington, Dela., but the bankruptcy court there didn't want the case. So Enron ended up in New York City. And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to line up $1.5 billion of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to keep the place operating. Normally, you make DIP arrangements before you file. \nIt would be lots of fun to give you Washington's take on all this, Enron being famous for close ties to the White House and the Republican Party. But we'll leave that for another day, because the juicy stuff probably won't show up until the Democrats get in gear. Hearings in the Republican-controlled House are set for this week, and will focus on accounting and stock analysts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enron's political relationships and what, if anything, the White House did during Enron's final days. \nAlthough some details are still murky, one thing is clear: Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside accountant, is in big trouble, and it (or its insurers) will have to fork over big bucks. Andersen's big problem stems from a company called JEDI--as in \"Star Wars\"--that Enron now says should have been on its books since 1997. Andersen allowed JEDI to remain off the books for years. The other deal, involving a company called Raptor, caused the net-worth disappearance that set Enron on the road to ruin. \nJEDI stands for Joint Energy Development Investments. It was a partnership between Enron and the California state-employees' pension fund, known as Cal-pers. The Force was with Enron, which invested the money--$250 million each from itself and Calpers--in power plants, energy stocks and such, making more than 20 percent a year. Pretty neat. In late 1997, Calpers was willing to invest $500 million in a new partnership, JEDI 2. But it wanted to first cash in its JEDI 1 chips, worth $383 million. Instead of just liquidating JEDI, Enron got cute. (I'm not sure why. Enron declined to comment.) It went looking for an outsider to fork over $383 million and take Calpers's place. Enter something called Chewco Investments--as in Chewbacca of \"Star Wars\" fame. Chewco was a partnership of Enron employees and some undisclosed outsiders. (Who they are and how much they made is a mystery, because Chewco is a private entity.) Chewco's investors didn't have a spare $383 million. So Enron lent Chewco $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan that Chewco took out elsewhere. Enron was thus at risk for its own JEDI stake and essentially all of Chewco's. That being the case, it's a mystery why Andersen let Enron keep JEDI off its books. Accounting experts who have looked at this transaction, which Enron disclosed last month, just shake their heads. Andersen has refused to comment, saying it's too early to reach conclusions. Enron has restated its earnings dating back to 1997 because it says JEDI should have been on its books since then. Guess what? The restated profits are far lower than the original ones. \nNow, to the deals that sank Enron. As in JEDI, Enron won't comment. These transactions involve four companies called Raptor. It looks like the Raptors were set up to let Enron use financial gymnastics to get gains from stocks it owned without actually selling them. The major holdings were Rhythms Net Connections, a now bankrupt start-up telecom company, and NewPower Holdings, which competes with established power companies for customers. At their height, Enron's stake in these companies totaled about $2 billion. Friday's value: about $40 million. Enron won't say why it didn't just sell the stock and take its profits. The most logical explanation is tax avoidance. \nNow, the key to Enron's undoing. The company committed to put $1.2 billion of Enron stock into the Raptors to make them more creditworthy. It didn't promise a fixed number of shares--it promised $1.2 billion worth, regardless of the share price. A seriously dumb move for a company that talks about hedging risks. In return for that commitment, the Raptors gave Enron $1.2 billion of promissory notes. Enron put them on its balance sheet as an asset. When a company adds to its assets and nothing else changes, its net worth rises. Hence, Enron marked up its net worth by $1.2 billion. \nBut as the stock prices of Rhythms, NewPower and Enron all sank, Enron faced having to fork over a ruinous number of new shares. So Enron paid $35 million to the Raptors' outside investors--yet another mysterious partnership--and liquidated the Raptors. That eliminated the notes, which eliminated the aforementioned $1.2 billion from Enron's net worth. That set off the now famous October run on Enron's credit, which ultimately led to bankruptcy. Now, far too late, Enron says it shouldn't have counted the notes as assets. \nThe bottom line: numbers matter. So does truth. Enron was too clever by half. And that's a good way to end up looking stupid. \nPhoto: Enron built a pipeline to the GOP, as well as to natural-gas fields \n\n\nPhoto: Enron built a pipeline to the GOP, as well as to natural-gas fields Photo: Kenneth Lay: Enron's CEO is a longtime friend of Bush's and was a top contributor to his campaign Graphic: (Chart) Sphere of Influence?

They indicated a critical need for supply TODAY \nto serve the California marketplace.  Secretary Richardson indicated he will \nexercise his emergency power under the Federal Power Act [section 202(c)] to \ndirect generation to California.  The Secretary indicated that DOE, under the \nFPA, will set a fair price for the power.\n \nIEP requests all its members to deliver as much generation as possible to \nCalifornia ASAP in order to avert potential shortages.  \n \nIn addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein called for regionwide price \ncaps and mandatory, reasonable long-term contracts between generators and the \nutilities.  They made the point that 4,000 - 5,000 MWs are being exported \nfrom the state, currently a lack of adequate planning and scheduling of \nresources/planned outages exists, and indicated that the CPUC would moved to \nimplement forward contracting.  \n \nIEP will forward the formal statement from the Press Conference (or a \nsummary) as soon as available.",

      "content": "MARKET NOTICE\nFebruary 4, 2002\n\nThe California Independent System Operator (ISO) is announcing the\nAggregated Distributed Generation Pilot Project (ADGPP).  The participation\nof Generating Units in the ISO's markets is currently limited to units with\na rated capacity of 1 MW or greater.  The ADGPP is intended to demonstrate\nthe feasibility of allowing physically separated small units (less than 1\nMW) to be aggregated as a means of reducing barriers to entry into the ISO\nmarkets.  ADGPP is currently intended to operate as follows: \n\n*\tGeneration units with a rated capacity of less than 1 MW may\nparticipate\n*\tGenerators will be aggregated through an Aggregated Distributed Unit\n(ADU), which will have an aggregated or total rated capacity greater than or\nequal to 1 MW but no more than 10 MW\n*\tThe total capacity for all units participating in this Pilot Project\nis limited to 50 MWs\n*\tADUs must contain generators that are in the same Demand Zone which\nare not on opposite sides of constrained transmission elements\n*\tEach ADU must be scheduled in the ISO Energy or Supplemental Energy\nMarket\n*\tNear real-time operational data will be required from ADU\n*\tProspective participants can propose unique methods and processes\nfor delivering the near real time operational data\n*\tGenerators will be considered SC Metered Entities, therefore they\nmust have Local Regulatory Authority approved interval metering\n*\tSettlement will occur through submitting aggregated Settlement\nQuality Meter Data (SQMD) by the SC representing the ADU\n\nAs noted above, units participating in the ADGPP will be allowed to\nparticipate in the ISO Energy and Supplemental Energy Markets only and will\nnot be allowed to participate in the ISO's Ancillary Services markets.  The\nincreased participation in the ISO Energy and Supplemental Energy markets\nwill provide greater market depth and will increase competition by expanding\nthe pool of generation available within the ISO Control Area.  The ADGPP is\nintended only to accommodate units less than 1 MW and is not intended to\nfacilitate \"portfolio bidding\" from Generating Units 1 MW or larger.\n\nThe ADGPP is also intended to improve the ISO's visibility of generating\nresources within the ISO Control Area by demonstrating the functionality of\nvarious basic-level operational data reporting processes which may be\nproposed by the prospective participants.  These operational data reporting\nprocesses should demonstrate the capability of delivering operational data\nfor the ADU to the ISO near real time and be economical from the small\nGenerator perspective.  The uniqueness of the operational data reporting\nprocesses proposed will be one factor in selection of participants in the\nprogram.  Thus, the project will also ensure that the participation of these\nresources in the ISO's markets will occur without compromising system\nreliability.\n\nThe ISO will be hosting a Workshop on Friday, March 8th to discuss the Pilot\nProject details.  Please contact Sue Happ (916) 608-7059 for reservations.\nParticipation in the workshop will only be allowed if reservations are made\nin advance. \n\nWorkshop Objectives:  \n\nMembers of the ISO staff from Metering, EMS, IT Security, Operations and\nMarket Services will be available to provide a general description of the\nPilot Program and to answer any questions from prospective participants.  An\nagenda and directions to the workshop will be provided on March 1st.   \n\nWorkshop Target Audience:  \n\nAggregators, Scheduling Coordinators and Prospective Generators.  \n\nThe ISO will allocate two hours on the agenda to interested Aggregators or\nScheduling Coordinators.  If you are interested in providing a presentation,\nplease Contact Ali Miremadi at (916) 608-7061 by February 22nd\n.    \nClient Relations Communications.0407\nCRCommunications@caiso.com <mailto:CRCommunications@caiso.com>",

I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.\n\n\nA couple of further things that I need:\n- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?\n\nGalen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.\n\n\nLet me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.",

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\n\nIndeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.\n\nSincerely,\n\ncharlene cerridwen",

Lynn asked if we should input their numbers, as today is the deadline for doing so.  I instructed her not to input the ONEOK numbers and to continue to use ours.  If ONEOK called about our response to their letter of November 1, I asked Lynn and Harry to advise that a written response would be forthcoming.\n\n\tI will try to get copies of the letter and attachment circulated.  For those of you who receive the copies, please note that only the letter and first page of the attachments were prepared and sent by ONEOK, and the second page was prepared internally by Harry.\n\n\tI will keep you advised.\n\n\tBritt",

He also seemed interested in exploring the\nidea of corporate culture. Both of these themes can be included under the\nbroad heading of strategic vision and the creation of a corporate culture\ncapable of pursuing that vision.\n\nSpecific questions are more difficult to imagine at this point. I think we\nshould rely on the general approach taken with Skilling and Sutton: How were\nthe various \"visions\" that have guided Enron's development been defined? How\nwere they achieved? What do you see as the key issues that should be\naddressed in our history?  Who are the crucial \"cluster\" of people to\ninterview for each issue? How do you see this project being used within Enron?\nI'll bet we can have a very productive hour with these general questions.\n\n- Joe Pratt",

If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at \nthe target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or \nassets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not \npermitted to discuss potential acquisitions.

      "content": "As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in \nENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston.  As far as I am aware \nthere is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or \nEnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should \nnot execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in \nHouston.  \n\nFrom a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate \ntrading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for \nEnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the \nrequisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question \nfor ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  \n\nWhere a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market \nrisk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate \nthe mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact \nthat Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all \ncredit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than \nEnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA \nhas sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this \ninternal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of \nDeliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com \nwhich can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection \nfrom.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms \nregardless of the Enron booking entity.\n\nMark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly \nwhere I haven't hit the mark !).\n\ntks,\n\nDenis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Seyfried\n11/06/2000 13:57\nTo: Elaine Bannerman-Sowah/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT, David A Wall/Risk Mgmt/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  \n\nIn reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should \nmatch across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two \nseparate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed \nout of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into \nEnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control \npersonnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.\n\nWe should try to close the open issues next week.  Could you coordinate the \nrelevant parties to ensure satisfactory results.\n\nthanks.\n\n\n\nElaine Bannerman-Sowah\n09/06/2000 14:44\nTo: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Denis O'Connell/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: ENA / Enron Credit.com\n\nBryan\n\nPlease could you confirm that CDS trades done by ENA :\n\n1.can be booked in London;\n2. risk-managed in London \n3. do not have to be back-to-backed with Enron Credit.com \n4. there is a Service Agreement between the two entities.\n\nMy understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of \ntransactions, for example where ENA has sold protection and Enron Credit.com \nhas bought protection on the same name. We would only need to match the terms \nwhere protection is bought and sold by the same Legal entity on the same name.\n\nYour response will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nElaine.",

Proficient's four founders worked together at Digital Island and then moved to Telegis Networks, which got hit hard by the collapsing Web-hosting market and went out of business earlier this year. At Proficient, the team has built a network management appliance that enables companies to route network traffic based on their access policies. The company secured $6 million in Series A funding from Canaan Partners and El Dorado Ventures in May and is looking to raise $10 million to $20 million in Series B next year. \n\nThree mergers also topped the news as Netegrity bought DataChannel in a $54 million deal. Online newspaper classifieds firms, PowerAdz and AdOne, also linked up as did Intelliseek and PlanetFeedback.com. \n\nAs the week grinds to a close, 12 companies reported raising $48 million. Proving that beauty to investors is skin deep, Switch Biotech, a developer of medications for dermatological conditions, scratched out EUR 18 million ($16 million) in its third round. And VentureWire has learned that Kyma Technologies, which develops nitride substrates for use in optoelectronics, communications, and microelectronics industries, raised $2.6 million in its Series A, led by a consortium of past individual investors. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>\t\n\n\nThe complete text of the stories below, as well as 15 additional venture-capital and private-company stories, are available today exclusively to subscribers to our new, premium service, VentureWire Professional.

The facilities range from geothermal operations \nand wind turbines to natural gas-burning co-generation plants. They produce \nabout 30 percent of the state's energy needs this time of year. \nThe qualifying facilities quit running because they no longer had cash to pay \nemployees and buy goods to keep their plants operating. Southern California \nEdison and PG&E have not paid the facilities for months, and they are owed \n$1.5 billion. \nA bill by Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, sought to give the PUC \nauthority to order utility companies to pay the qualifying facilities in \nadvance. The measure also would direct utility companies to pay back the \nDepartment of Water Resources, which has bought power for them since \nmid-January, before paying back others. \nThe legislation passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly, where \nRepublicans objected to the haste of the action, among other concerns. On \nFriday, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Democrats and \nRepublicans would work through the weekend to come up with a plan that could \nwin passage Monday. \nMeanwhile, Smith said the approach contained in the legislation would make \nPG&E's finances even worse. The company is collecting $400 million in bills \neach month but owes $1.4 billion a month for energy purchases. \nOn Tuesday, Davis called PG&E's and Edison's practice of collecting bills \nfrom their customers to pay the qualifying facilities and not forwarding the \nmoney \"immoral.\" On Friday, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor \nhad nothing more to add. \nJoseph Fichera, a member of the governor's team of advisers negotiating with \nutility companies, said PG&E's refusal to fully pay qualifying facilities \nleads the facilities to shut down, which in turn forces the state to find the \nenergy elsewhere. \n\"They are still collecting and not paying out the full amount,\" Fichera said. \n\"The consequences of that is that it increases the amount of power the state \nhas to buy on the spot market and creates a bigger problem for everybody.\" \nFichera said negotiations with Edison and PG&E would continue through the \nweekend. He said there's nothing wrong with PG&E articulating its position, \nbut company officials have misjudged the plan and should keep in mind the PUC \nwill proceed on the qualifying facilities order in a way the company's \nfinances can work. \n\"They need to get the QFs online,\" Fichera said. \"They need to see the bigger \npicture that (having) the QFs offline is exacerbating a problem we call \nsummer.\" \nStaff writer Mike Taugher contributed to this story.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------\nA lone voice for price caps: U.S. regulator fears 'a disaster'\nBy David Whitney\nBee Washington Bureau \n(Published March 24, 2001) \nWASHINGTON -- William Massey used to be a team player. Then the lights \nstarted flickering in California. \nNow, Massey is the dissenting voice of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission -- a preacher, an absolute convert to the idea that free markets \nbe damned because California is getting a raw deal. \nWholesale electricity prices are rocketing into the stratosphere. Gov. Gray \nDavis, joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington, is screaming for \nprice controls. And yet Massey said his colleagues wouldn't do their job to \nensure \"just and reasonable\" prices and rein in price gougers. \n\"I fear a disaster is in the making,\" Massey told a House subcommittee this \nweek. He said that without price controls this summer, he fears the worst. \nMassey isn't just pounding the table at congressional hearings. In recent \norders by the commission, he has been the lone naysayer, uttering in strong \nterms the doom and gloom that will be thrust upon the state by an agency he \nsays is refusing to follow the Federal Power Act's mandate that it enforce \njust and reasonable wholesale rates. \nTwo weeks ago, Massey condemned as insufficient the commission's order \nfinding that a dozen or so power producers may have overcharged California by \nas much as $69 million for January power sales. \nMassey called the commission action \"facially arbitrary, capricious and an \nabuse of discretion.\" Massey said his colleagues only focused on power sales \nabove $273 a megawatt-hour sold during Stage 3 alerts of imminent rolling \nblackouts. \n\"There is no logic to this methodology other than limiting the universe of \npotential refunds,\" Massey wrote. \nAsked about this at the House hearing, Massey was even more pointed. When it \ncomes to ferreting out price gougers, Massey said the message is that \"FERC \nis going to be looking for the wallet under the lamp post with the lights \nshining, and nowhere else.\" \nThese are welcome words to beleaguered state officials and utility executives \nwho are growing increasingly frustrated that neither the commission nor the \nBush administration seems to be heeding the concerns of California and the \nWest over the worsening power situation. \n\"Commissioner Massey has a very good understanding,\" said an appreciative \nSen. Dianne Feinstein, author of price-control legislation that Massey has \nendorsed. \nJoe Nipper, senior vice president of the American Public Power Association, \nsaid the fact that Massey is alone in advocating firmer protection for \nCalifornia and its consumers makes his role even more important. \n\"Thank God he is there to articulate that point of view because if he \nweren't, you wouldn't hear it at all,\" Nipper said. \nMassey concedes that his role as commission dissenter is new. In his eight \nyears on the commission, the former legal services lawyer and aide to retired \nArkansas Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers has been known more as a team player. \nNominated by President Clinton for the post in 1993, Massey was fully behind \nthe notion that free and open markets were the way to go in the energy \nbusiness. \nWhen California's electric deregulation package started rolling through the \nagency in 1996, Massey was right there, urging it on, proclaiming the glories \nof open competition. \n\"It's true that as the commission has marched toward competition in the open \nmarkets, I've been there in a leadership role,\" Massey said during an \ninterview. \nSeveral Midwest shortages during a 1998 heat wave were the first indications \nthat something was amiss. Massey said he was skeptical about the prevailing \nview on the commission that the Midwest problem was the result of \"the \nconfluence of a series of circumstances that were unlikely to recur, the \nso-called perfect storm.\" \n\"I thought that was a naive statement,\" he said. \nBut Massey said this didn't shake his confidence in deregulation and \nmarket-based competition so much as it caused him to doubt the commission's \nability to handle shifting circumstances. \n\"The commission's attitude was that we couldn't go wrong, that competition \nwould always be better than the old-fashioned regulatory market and \nessentially that any old market structure would work,\" he said. \"That is \nsimply not true.\" \nThen came California. \n\"I just feel like our actions have been too little, too late all along,\" he \nsaid. \"As billions of dollars are changing hands, we were studying it. Then \nwe are investigating it,\" he said. \n\"But for me, competitive markets have to produce just and reasonable prices. \nA dysfunctional market that produces outrageous prices is unlawful. And I \nthink my agency has not taken strong enough steps to save California and the \nWest from a wildly dysfunctional electricity market.\" \nMassey was on the commission when it basically rubber-stamped the California \nderegulation plan, the first in the nation. He said it arrived as a package, \nmuch of it written into state law, and that the agency did not ask hard \nquestions such as how California could get the best price for consumers by \nrelying on day-ahead power purchases on the volatile spot market. \n\"Essentially we deferred to the market design that was handed to us,\" Massey \nsaid. \"We did say that it was a work in progress, and that we would be paying \nattention to it. \nBut to assume the spot markets would usually produce the lowest prices now, \nin retrospect, seems naive. We are now very critical of that market design \nbut we did approve it.\" \nNow the commission, with only three of its five seats filled, is led by the \npanel's only Republican, Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to price \ncontrols. \nThe panel's other Democrat, Linda Breathitt, is similarly disposed. \n\"I am the lone voice crying in the wilderness,\" Massey said. \nBut with the power crisis pushing up wholesale rates throughout the West, \nMassey said this is not the time to be clinging to ideology. \n\"I do not think it is worth bringing down the economy of an entire region of \nthe country just for the theoretical purity,\" he said. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nMarch 24, 2001\nCalifornia's Choices All Look Painful\nBy LAURA M. HOLSON\nOS ANGELES, March 23 \u0001* California's energy crisis seems to get worse with \neach passing day.\nThis week, Californians were once again plunged into darkness as warm weather \nand a large number of shuttered power plants caused blackouts from Santa \nMonica to San Francisco. In offices in and around Sacramento, frenzied \nnegotiators continue their months-long talks to design a settlement to keep \nthe nearly bankrupt utilities afloat and creditors at bay.\nAnd despite a dizzying 190 bills introduced in the Legislature to address the \ncrisis, the bickering among politicians persists. Republican leaders have \ncalled for the ouster of state utility officials, and California's controller \nwarned that the state's general fund was in danger of being frittered away \nunless decisive action was taken. \nTwo months ago, Gov. Gray Davis promised a speedy end to the crisis. But all \nthe solutions proposed so far seem as fragile and tenuous as the grid itself.\nNow a growing chorus of economists, business leaders and policy experts are \nsaying what most agree that Mr. Davis will not utter: the state cannot spend \nits way out of this crisis, and politicians are delaying an inevitable, \nalbeit unpopular, end \u0001* raising retail electricity rates significantly. The \ndesire to satisfy all parties is costly and has caused confusion and \nindecision.\n\"The solution to the policy problem is moving agonizingly slowly because \nthere are several powerful political groups that can block any piece of \nlegislation,\" said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chief economic adviser in \nthe Clinton White House who is now the dean of the Haas School of Business at \nthe University of California at Berkeley. \"California's politicians don't \nseem to have enough power or conviction \u0001* I think it's power \u0001* to get these \ngroups to agree.\" \nFurther, said Steve Fleishman, a Merrill Lynch utility analyst in New York: \n\"The government officials keep trying to plug the holes in the dam when they \nspout up. But there are too many things that need to be paid within the \ncurrent utility rate structure.\" \nIn an interview today, Governor Davis reiterated what he has said for months: \nCalifornia's biggest problem is short supply \u0001* no major power plants have \nbeen built in 10 years \u0001* and he has invoked his emergency power to put more \ngeneration online quickly. He warned, too, that state negotiators were \nproceeding with caution to avoid the kind of mistakes the architects of \nderegulation made in the first place. \"One of the reasons we are in trouble \ntoday was because there was a rush to judgment,\" he said. \"We are not going \nto make that mistake again.\"\nBut for a brief moment recently, it looked as if the state had finally \nmarshaled its forces and was well on its way to presenting Californians with \na cohesive plan. The state treasurer's office hired bankers to help sell a \n$10 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind, that would help pay for \npower now and stabilize prices over time. \nState negotiators hoping to avoid a taxpayer bailout announced a preliminary \nagreement with Southern California Edison to buy its transmission lines for \nabout $2.76 billion. And Governor Davis proudly told reporters that his team \nhad negotiated a successful round of long-term power contracts that would \nhelp keep California's lights on. \nBut almost every promising announcement has had a less-enticing twist. \nIntense negotiations with the privately-owned utilities drag on week after \nweek. Southern California Edison has not finished a deal to sell its \ntransmission lines, a necessity if it is to begin paying bills owed since \nNovember. \"Progress has been made,\" said Bob Foster, Edison's chief \nnegotiator. But he warned, \"I don't want to sound overly optimistic.\"\nPacific Gas and Electric, for its part, has not announced anything, even in \nprinciple. John Nelson, a spokesman for the utility, did not return calls \nseeking comment. \nRegarding the long-term power contracts, a report released this week says \nthat the state has received commitments for less than half the 6,000 \nmegawatts it hopes to secure for this summer. The power generators, too, can \nopt out of their contracts for a variety of reasons, including a failure by \nthe state to sell bonds by July 1. Governor Davis said today that in most \ncases, much of the energy the state wanted to buy for this summer was no \nlonger available. That shortfall could require the state to buy more than 15 \npercent of the energy it needs in the expensive spot market, nearly triple \nthe amount he once said he wanted. \nStill, the issue that has caused the biggest controversy is who has first \nrights to the money now being collected from ratepayers. (Pacific Gas and \nElectric and Southern California Edison now have $4.4 billion in their \ncoffers.) State officials have said that according to the law drafted in \nJanuary to ensure the state could buy power on behalf of the utilities, the \nDepartment of Water Resources should be paid first. The utilities are saying \nthey are first in line. Whatever the outcome, the law's ambiguity has been a \nproblem for the state treasurer, Philip Angelides, who said it has not only \ncost him precious time, but could put the bond offering in jeopardy unless it \nis clear how the revenues will be divided. \n\"The danger of this is if you let problems like this multiply, the situation \ngets worse and worse,\" he said. California's Public Utilities Commission is \nexpected to rule on this issue. (Governor Davis said he expected the \ncommission to agree that the state should be paid first.) \nBut Mr. Angelides did not want to wait that long. Instead, he said, he and \nhis team approached legislators to write another law so he could proceed with \nthe state's $10 billion bond offering in May. \nBut even then, he contends, the bond offering is only a short-term fix at \nbest. \"After the $10 billion is exhausted, we can't keep borrowing and \nborrowing and borrowing,\" Mr. Angelides said. \"The reality is our lack of \ninvestment in power plants and inability to conserve are going to cost us \nmore.\" \nMr. Angelides has a point. But the governor's resistance to raising rates is \nat best a negotiating tool. The governor has told some people that he is open \nto raising rates, but only after the utilities make the concessions he wants, \npeople close to the negotiations with the utilities said. It is part of his \noverall strategy, these people said \u0001* one that includes building more power \nplants and conserving energy, both crucial in helping California minimize \ndisasters this year and next.\nBut that does little to solve the problem of the $13 billion in debts the \nutilities have already incurred. And that provides little comfort to the \nlikes of Hal Dittmer, president and owner of the Wellhead Electric Company, a \nsmall power generation company in Sacramento, who decided to close down his \nthree power plants in February because he had not been paid all the money \nowed by Pacific Gas and Electric. No solution now being discussed, he said, \neither in the legislature or with the utilities themselves, really addresses \nhis problem. And like many of the utilities' creditors, he is growing \nimpatient.\n\"The word I would use for what is going on in Sacramento is dithering,\" said \nJack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development \nCorporation, who has seen a swarm of recruiters from other states approach \nLos Angeles businesses recently in an effort to woo them away. \"I think what \nthey have to understand is that they are putting California's economic future \nat risk.\" \nGovernor Davis, while sympathetic to his critics' frustrations, dismisses \nthem. \"They are viewing the process from afar,\" he said. \"From the \ngovernment's perspective, we are moving at warp speed.\"\nBut that may not be fast enough. Today, in Sacramento, the State Assembly \nrejected a plan that would have allowed smaller power generators, which have \ncontracts directly with the utilities, to be paid. Unlike their larger \ncounterparts, companies like Mr. Dittmer's do not have their sales guaranteed \nby the state and are themselves threatened by bankruptcy.\nThe utilities have been negotiating with the smaller generators for months, \nbut industry analysts say the two groups are bitter rivals and no agreement \nis likely soon. And to make matters even more precarious, smaller generators \ncould be the likeliest to force the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, in \npart, because they want their money and have the least to lose.\n\"Politics is not just about keeping the lights on,\" Ms. Tyson said. \"It's \nabout making sure that all parties are represented.\" And that is contrary to \nthe business world, she added, \"where it's about getting the job done.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nLocal generators win small victory\nFiled: 03/24/2001 \nBy VIC POLLARD, Californian Sacramento Bureau e-mail: \nvpollard@bakersfield.com \nSACRAMENTO -- With help from Kern County's three Assembly members, owners of \nsmall natural gas-fired generating plants like those in Kern's oil fields won \na partial victory Friday in their campaign to get paid for the electricity \nthey sell to nearly bankrupt utilities. \nKern County lawmakers helped bury a bill that would have required the big \nutilities to start paying the small generators -- but at a price below what \nit costs them plants to operate. \nThe legislation is expected to be taken up in revised form Monday, and Kern's \nlawmakers said they hope it will contain a better deal for the small \ngenerators. \nThe action came at the end of a week of feverish activity sparked by rolling \nblackouts that hit unexpectedly Monday and Tuesday. The blackouts were caused \npartly by the shutdown of many small generating facilities because they have \nnot been paid for their electricity in months. \nThe crucial vote came late Thursday, when the Assembly's Republicans \nunanimously opposed the low-price payment bill, depriving it of the \ntwo-thirds vote needed for passage, in the face of heavy pressure from \nDemocratic legislative leaders. They wanted to push the bill through \nThursday, partly because most lawmakers were scheduled to leave Friday on an \nannual lobbying trip to Washington, D.C. \nNo one felt the pressure more than Dean Florez of Shafter, the only Democrat \nto vote against the measure. \n\"It was really tough,\" Florez said Friday. \nAssemblymen Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield and Phil Wyman of Tehachapi were among \nthe Republicans voting against the measure. \nFlorez and Ashburn said the main reason they voted no was that the bill would \nhave locked in a price for the small generating facilities that would have \nmade it impossible for the natural-gas fired plants, and many others, to keep \noperating. \n\"If they're losing money generating electricity, they're going to close \ndown,\" Ashburn said, adding to the state's shortage of electricity. \nOn Friday, after hours of closed-door meetings between Democratic and \nRepublican leaders and officials of Gov. Gray Davis' administration, Assembly \nSpeaker Robert Hertzberg announced that negotiations would continue and the \nissue would come up again Monday. \nThe problem for local lawmakers was that the price established by the \ngovernor's office, 7.9 cents per kilowatt hour for a five-year contract, is \nanywhere from one-half to one-third of what it costs the gas-fired generators \nto produce electricity because of the current high price of natural gas. \nUnder current law, the gas-fired generators are assured of a price for their \nelectricity that takes into account fluctuations in the price of natural gas. \nFlorez said the price being considered by the PUC would have made it \neconomical only for wind- and solar-powered generators.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nEnron drops power project \nThe move surprises critics and supporters of a Lake Elsinore hydroelectric \nplant. \nBy Thomas Buckley\nThe Press-Enterprise\nLAKE ELSINORE\nEnron North America has pulled the plug on its plans for a hydroelectric \npower plant in Lake Elsinore. \nFriday's surprise move does not kill the proposal but dims the hopes of \nsupporters like the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District for the $450 \nmillion project. \nBut opponents, worried about power lines and the potential adverse effect on \nthe environment, were overjoyed. \n\"That's fantastic,\" said Barbara Bowers, La Cresta resident and member of a \nrecently-empaneled project oversight citizen's committee. \"(Enron officials) \nhave finally discovered what we knew all along: This was not a viable \nproject.\" \nWhile speculation about why Enron backed away from the proposal centered on \nthe instability of both the lake and state-power market, company officials \nsaid their decision was a matter of timing. \nEnron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth said the timetable for both the hydro plant \nand the 23 miles of power lines that would have been strung along the \nElsinore Mountains ridgeline was moving much slower than expected, prompting \nthe company to re-allocate its resources to other projects in the state. \n\"We need to pick up the pace with our power-plant development,\" Russeth said. \nWhile the water district still holds a three-year preliminary federal permit \nfor a hydroelectric project and consultant Nevada Hydro has an agreement with \nthe water district, observers say chances are Enron's departure makes the \nproject impossible. \nNevada Hydro is expected to continue work on the project, Enron said, but no \none close to the project believes the water district and consulting firm can \npull it off alone. Attempts to contact Nevada Hydro officials were \nunsuccessful. \n\"If a company like Enron is not going ahead with this, it is unlikely the \nproject will ever be built,\" said county Supervisor Bob Buster. \nBut not everyone is willing to throw in the towel on the idea that has been \nin play for a decade, has been declared dead before. \nDropping the project entirely is \"not an option,\" said water district board \nPresident Kris Anderson. \n\"We've got the permit and we've got three years to get the license to build,\" \nAnderson said. \"I would hate to see the district get out now.\" \nDistict officials will met next week to decide how to proceed. \nWildomar Chamber of Commerce President and citizen's committee member John \nPurpura agreed. \n\"It's a sad case and I hope EVMWD can find another company to step into \nEnron's shoes,\" Purpura said. \nIn its latest incarnation, the pumped-storage proposal was born last summer \nwhen Enron first showed an interest. \nThe water district was poised to cut its ties to Nevada Hydro, a consulting \nfirm long associated with trying to build project, when Enron said it might \nbe interested in pursuing the proposal. \nIn the following months, Enron, a multi-billion multi-national energy firm, \nspent thousands on research and securing the preliminary federal permit for \nthe district. \nPeople who lived near the lake where the power plant would go were irked by \nwhat they saw as corporate heavy-handedness, while environmentalists and \nforest residents became alarmed by power line and reservoir construction \nplans. \nThe federal permit to pursue a final building license was secured in February \nand the county-backed citizen's committee, after much controversy, had its \nfirst meeting five days ago. \nBackers have said the project would be a godsend to the lake, providing money \nto buy water to keep it full and to help fund the upcoming $15 million lake \nclean-up. Neither is likely to happen now, observers say. \n\"All the expectations they raised have been dashed,\" said Buster, who sits on \nthe joint-powers agency in charge of the lake clean-up project. \"They owe the \ncommunity an explanation.\" \nEnvironmentalist activist Gene Frick, who has fought the project for five \nyears and once promised to chain himself to an oak tree, was gleeful at \nEnron's decision. \n\"I thank you,\" Frick said, \"my associates thank you, and the oak trees thank \nyou.\" \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------\nJobs at utilities appear safe -- for now \nPUC ruling offers some security at Edison and PG&E, but the threat of \nbankruptcy hovers over many. \nMarch 24, 2001 \nBy CATRINE JOHANSSON\nThe Orange County Register \nSafe for now, but for how long? \nThat's the question for thousands of employees at Southern California Edison \nand Pacific Gas & Electric, which are near bankruptcy after paying billions \nmore for power over the past 10 months than they could charge customers. \nThe utilities hoped to save about $650 million by laying off some 3,000 \nemployees, but a ruling last week by the state Public Utilities Commission \nhalted most of those plans. \nEdison had planned to cut about 2,000 jobs during the course of a year. About \n400 of them were cut in December, while the remaining 1,600 were to be cut \nduring 2001. \nShaun Rolow, a part-time Edison meter reader in Kern County, said he and his \nco-workers feel their jobs are fairly safe, thanks to the PUC ruling, but \nthey worry about the future. \n\"Most guys are very relieved, but we also talk a lot about the danger of \nEdison going bankrupt,\" he said. \"We feel uneasy, but also try to joke about \nit. Like when we get our paychecks, we joke about whether they'll be any \ngood.\" \nThe 400 employees let go in December were contract workers whose contracts \nwere up anyway, said Edison spokesman Steve Hansen. The PUC ruling does not \nreinstate any of those workers. It does, however, prohibit further layoffs in \ncustomer call centers, meter-reading departments, outage-response teams and \nnew-customer connection departments. \nExactly how many of the 1,600 other jobs are protected by the PUC ruling - \nand how many are not - is unclear, as Edison officials haven't completed \ntheir analysis of the ruling, Hansen said. \nOf the 1,600, \"less than 50\" were laid off before last week's PUC ruling. \nWhether any of those jobs will be reinstated remains to be decided. \nSteven Carlton, a 20-year Edison employee who is an electricity foreman in \nthe Los Alamitos area, said a possible bankruptcy filing for the company is a \nmore immediate worry than layoffs. \n\"We know that there are too few people to do what we do as it is, so we \nwouldn't get laid off, but we do wonder what's going to happen in the future \nif the company goes bankrupt,\" Carlton said. \nThe PUC also rejected the utilities' plans to cut expenses by reading \nelectricity meters every other month and using estimated bills for the \ninterim months. \nBimonthly meter readings would, according to the PUC ruling, \"create \ninaccuracies in calculating baseline usage, and consumers will not be able to \nsee the results of their conservation efforts.\" \nAlthough the PUC allowed the utilities to continue reducing overtime, Edison \nhas decided to pay for overtime work in some cases. \n\"We continue to restrict overtime, except in cases where the public or \nemployee safety are compromised,\" Hansen said. He would not elaborate on what \nkinds of situations those would be, but acknowledged that the company had \nchanged a strict no-overtime policy that left residents of an apartment \ncomplex in Fountain Valley without electricity for a weekend in January. \n\"If a community loses power, we'll send out people to fix it - even if it is \non the weekend,\" Hansen said. \nThe utilities can petition the PUC to change the ruling on layoffs, but \nthere's no word yet on whether they will do so. \n\"We don't know yet, but we do expect the utilities to appeal,\" said Pat \nLavin, business manager for Local 47 of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers, which represents 4,100 Edison workers. \nThe IBEW is one of the unions in the Coalition of California Utility \nEmployees, which filed the grievance with the PUC that prompted the ruling. \nLavin said the unions watch the situation closely and are prepared to \nchallenge future layoff plans by the utilities - regardless of whether the \ntargeted employees are union members.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nState power regulator proposes 40% rate increase \nPosted at 12:00 noon PST Monday, March 26, 2001 \nBY KAREN GAUDETTE \n\nAssociated Press Writer \n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent \nhike in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage \ncustomers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the \nhot summer months. \nLoretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates \nshould increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate \naverages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. \nThe higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC \nmeets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by \nGov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the \ncommission. \nLynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent \nincrease, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems \nthis summer. \n``That number should be all that is needed going forward,'' she said at a \nnews conference, ``to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of \nthe state can issue bonds.'' \nLynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine \nWalwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary. \nAny increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the \nPUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already \nscheduled for next year. \nLynch also supports a ``tiered'' rate system that would charge residential \nand businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back. So \nit should encourage conservation. \nThe governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can \nbe resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that \nrates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several \nlawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate \nincrease is inevitable. \nSouthern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have \npushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would \nbe insufficient to cover its bills and the state's. \nAdministration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San \nDiego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to \ngive the companies cash to pay their bills. \nPG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due \nto high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law \nprevents them from collecting from their customers. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nCalif State Treasurer: Electricity Rate Hike Inevitable\n\n03/26/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The State of California will have to raise electricity \nrates for consumers to reflect the dramatic price rise seen in the wholesale \npower market, State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Monday in an interview on \nCNBC. \nAngelides declined to specify how much rates would rise from current levels, \nhowever, and he said that the state's two main investor-owned utilities might \npossibly have to reorganize their financial situation through a bankruptcy \nproceeding.\n\"It's hard to tell,\" what the percentage of the increase would be, Angelides \nsaid, \"but there's no mystery that rates are going up. We have to match the \nprice of power to what we pay for it to keep the lights on.\" \nThe rate increase would both curb demand and assure lenders that the state \nwill be able to repay the $10 billion in bonds it wants to issue to cover the \ncosts of purchasing power. \nAs for the utilities, \"It's their job to reorganize themselves inside or \noutside of a bankruptcy proceeding,\" Angelides said, adding that the \nutilities' parent companies greatly benefitted from electric deregulation for \nthree years before suffering huge losses in 2000. \nSince the state began buying power on behalf of its two near-bankrupt \nutilities - PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison \nInternational's (EIX) Southern California Edison - in January, it has spent \nalmost $3 billion covering the difference between the utilities' generated \npower and their customers' electricity usage. \nAngelides spoke from New York, where he is trying to convince Wall Street \nbankers to help issue the $10 billion in bonds. The debt issue will provide \n\"breathing room to get to a long-term plan by September to balance market \nprices and rates,\" he said. The money will also be used for \"a very dramatic \nconservation program.\" \n\"If we can get demand down 5% to 10%, we can get power prices down,\" \nAngelides said. \nBut the treasurer also said that the merchant power companies in the state \nhave acted unconscionably. Reducing demand, he said, will put the state in a \nbetter position to get the producers to negotiate reasonable long-term prices \nas part of a sustainable solution to the state's power and financial crisis. \n\"The first problem is a supply and demand imbalance. If we in California deny \nthat we're denying reality. But the other problem is that generators have \nbeen charging unfair and unreasonably prices,\" said Angelides, who said \ngenerators have to \"take their foot off our throat and meet us half-way.\" \n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------\nPossible rate hikes cheer California utility investors \nMICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer\nMonday, March 26, 2001 \n,2001 Associated Press \n(03-26) 11:46 PST SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The prospect of substantially higher \nelectricity rates in California drew rave reviews Monday on Wall Street as \ninvestors snapped up the long-suffering stocks of the state's two largest \nutilities. \nWith about two hours of trading left on the New York Stock Exchange, shares \nin PG&E Corp. surged $3.80, or 36 percent, to $14.45 while Edison \nInternational's stock gained $3.79, or 34 percent, to $14.99. \nSan Francisco-based PG&E and Rosemead-based Edison International own \nutilities that have been flirting with bankruptcy for months as they paid for \nsoaring wholesale electricity costs that couldn't be passed on to customers \nunder the state's deregulation law. \nAfter months of resistance to the idea, state political leaders and \nregulators are poised to swallow a bitter pill and prescribe significant new \nrate increases. \nCalifornia's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in electricity \nrates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customers to cut back \non usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summer months. \nLoretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates \nshould increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate \naverages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The higher rates could go into effect \nas early as Tuesday, when the PUC meets. \nGov. Gray Davis remains confident the state's power crisis can be resolved \nwithout further rate hikes, an aide said Monday. But his high-level financial \naides warned legislative leaders Friday that consumers could feel significant \npain when all is said and done. \nAlthough nothing has been completed, news of the likely rate increases leaked \nout during the weekend and raised hopes on Wall Street that the darkest days \nfor the two utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California \nEdison, might be behind them. \nThe utilities' executives, backed by numerous industry analysts, have \ncontended for months that the state needed to approve hefty rate increases to \nease a power crisis that threatens to make rolling blackouts a routine event \nthis summer. \nThe higher rates are seen as a way to ease the financial burden of the \nutilities, which say they have run up debts of more than $13 billion buying \nwholesale electricity during the last 10 months. Analysts also reason higher \nelectricity bills will persuade more customers to reduce their usage and \nreduce the frequency of blackouts this summer. \nThe likely rate increases weren't the only good news for utility shareholders \nMonday. \nOver the weekend, Southern California Edison said it will resume payments to \nalternative energy providers known as ``qualifying facilities'' -- a move \nexpected to reduce the chances that the disgruntled generators will band \ntogether and try to force the utility into bankruptcy. \nIn a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, Pacific Gas and \nElectric disclosed that it had received more breathing room from some of its \nkey creditors. The utility has defaulted on a $1 billion revolving credit \nline, but the banks that made the loans have given the company until April 13 \nto work things out, the filing said. \nPG&E also revealed that its electricity losses could result in a $4.1 billion \ncharge against its fourth-quarter earnings. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nDuke says would take less for California power sales \nPosted at 11:55 a.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001 \nNEW YORK, (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp. said Monday it would take less money \nfor power it sold to California customers during January and February, \nprovided it receives guarantees it will get paid. \nResponding to accusations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \nthat it overcharged its California customers by $17.8 million during power \nshortages in January and February, Duke said in a statement that the prices \nit charged were ''reasonable'' given the high risks that generators would not \nbe paid. \nIn a filing with FERC Friday, Duke President and Chief Executive Officer Jim \nDonnell said, ``We could be willing to forgo collection of the credit \npremiums for these months, provided we receive the FERC clearing price.'' \nCalifornia's Independent System Operator, which covers 75 percent of the \nstate's power grid, has accused generators of overcharging customers by $6.2 \nbillion since May. \nHouston-based Duke said that during the months of January and February its \nbids included a credit premium to cover the ''substantial risk'' of \nnonpayment. Duke said the credit premium and market condition were \nresponsible for its bids exceeding the FERC determined market clearing price. \nFERC had set a $273 megawatt per hour cap on power sales to California during \nthe Stage 3 emergencies in January and February. \nShares of Duke were up $1.27, or more than 3 percent, to $39.15 in afternoon \ntrading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared to a 52-week high of \n$45.2188 and low of $24.8750. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nMarch 26, 2001\nPower Woes Raise Questions Over Control of Gas Pipelines\nBy RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN\narly last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen \ncompanies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from \nTexas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved \nCalifornia. \nThe winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, \nwhich buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso \nMerchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, \nin total, for bits and pieces.\nWhy pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint \nagainst El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer \nis simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its \nsister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of \nnatural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. \nAccording to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of \nfilings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally \nthat the deal would give them \"more control\" of gas markets, including the \n\"ability to influence the physical market\" to benefit the company's financial \npositions.\nEl Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response \nto California's complaint, said the state \"grossly distorted\" company \ndocuments by quoting words and phrases out of context.\nThe dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the \nnatural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric \npower plants.\nAt issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive \nabuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal \nregulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry \nofficials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor \nunregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize \nprofits.\nMore than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, \nmoving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to \nfuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. \nNot long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But \nexperts say that several regions, including California, New York and New \nEngland, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. \nIn California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in \nthe federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy \ncrisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from \nprice manipulation and profiteering.\n\"They are the market maker with this pipeline,\" said Loretta Lynch, the \npresident of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled \nto cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. \nEl Paso \"sets the price in California,\" Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was \nintentional. \"It has affected the price,\" she said, \"for everything related \nto heat and electrical power prices in the state.\" \nCalifornia's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant \n\"has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity\" on \nthe pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's \nowner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to \nother users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said \nthat El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit \nanticompetitive behavior.\nThe sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to \nmake money by widening the \"basis spread\" \u0001* the difference between what gas \ncan be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of \nthe pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California.\nAs it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price \nof gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that \npushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 \nbillion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 \nmonths, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup \nthe costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically \nis less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in \nthe state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas- New Mexico price in \nDecember.\nTo executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations \nof market manipulation are ludicrous. \nHigh gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are \neasily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's \nutilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or \nstore enough gas for winter.\n\"The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,\" \nsaid Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North \nAmerica. \nSome El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific \nGas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in \na filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed \ncompany documents. \n\"It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy \nCorporation,\" the utility said in the filing, \"that the business strategy El \nPaso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue \ninvolved manipulation of price spreads.\" \nThe agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal \nbetween El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the \nagency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry \nobservers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as \nthe agency's public meeting on Wednesday.\nNonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said \nrecently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of \nthe capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option \nthat would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic \nfeet of gas a day. \nCritics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the \nchance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that \ntheir decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement.\nSurrendering the pipeline capacity made for a \"gut-wrenching\" decision, Mr. \nSmith said, but was \"a first- class gesture\" to California. El Paso Merchant \npaid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until \nMay 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that \ninvestment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative.\n\"No doubt about it,\" Mr. Clark said, \"we made good money.\" \nThe question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is \nexpected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The \ncompany also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los \nAngeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent \npipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso \ndenied the accusation.\nWith pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about \nanticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created \nsoaring profits for energy marketers and traders. \nDynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints \nto federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing \ncapacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California.\nIn a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline \ncompanies routinely favored affiliates. \"Abuses abound because of financial \nwindfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased \ncomplexity of the market,\" the company said.\n\"There are some red flags right now,\" said William L. Massey, a member of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was \ntroubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and \npower marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural \ngas. El Paso is in all those businesses.\n\"What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at \nwork? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand \nsignals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of \naffiliate abuse?\" he said. \nMany in the industry do not believe changes are needed. \n\"There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,\" said \nStanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron \nCorporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of \nAmerica, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which \nCalifornia has brought its complaint about El Paso.\nTo its critics, El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns. It operates the \nnation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest \nreserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal \nCorporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market \ncapitalization of $32 billion. \nAt a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts \nheard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's \nmuch better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is \nexpected to earn about $1.4 billion.\nEl Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's \nprofits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it \nis expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest \nquarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to \"commodity \nmarket and trading margins\" that were enhanced by \"power price volatility, \nparticularly in the Western United States.\" \nCritics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According \nto the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was \nawarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. \nWise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the \nbid. \nThe presentation outlined what it termed \"strategic advantages,\" including \n\"more control of total physical markets\" and the \"ability to influence the \nphysical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,\" according to \nthe sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to \ngive it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support \nfinancial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its \nrisk.\nFor every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation \nsaid, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. \nUnder the heading \"Challenges,\" according to the sealed filings, the \npresentation stated that storage was needed \"to help manipulate physical \nspreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.\"\nOn April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at \nthe time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update \nfor directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: \"We will make \nmoney two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.\" \nThe language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by \nincreasing the gas flow in the pipeline \u0001* the load factor \u0001* while increasing \nthe difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it \ncould be sold for at the other end \u0001* the basis spread.\nIn an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the \nunit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in \nmonths in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices \nin the spot market. \nOtherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the \npipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in \nprices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso \nMerchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last \nyear, with no capacity withheld to increase prices.\nThe company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in \nthe sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal \nregulators, said California's complaint had \"misconstrued and incorrectly \ninterpreted\" what it termed \"snippets of data.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nSoCal Edison To Pay QFs On Going-Forward Basis\n\n03/25/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nROSEMEAD, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's (EIX) Southern \nCalifornia Edison unit said that, in anticipation of pending action by the \nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission to restructure the way qualifying \nfacility generators, or QFs, will be paid, the utility will resume payments \nto QFs on a going-forward basis. \nIn a press release Sunday, Southern California Edison said it has set aside \nfunds in a separate account and will make payments in advance of expected \nApril deliveries.\nPayment processing would begin immediately after the CPUC approves on Tuesday \na proposed decision to restructure QF prices. \nAdvance payments will be based on the generators' historical production level \nand the PUC's pricing order. \nThe company said it will be able to make payments only up to \"an aggregate \namount that is available to us from rates actually received for QF payments.\" \n\nSouthern California Edison said that \"in recognition of the state's need for \nall the electricity it can get during these times, SCE is hereby instituting \na program to pay those QFs that continue to provide electricity to the \nutility.\" \nThe company is \"leaving it up to the discretion of the\" PUC \"as to how the \npayment structure will be revamped and how we should allocate the payments to \nQFs.\" \nThe PUC will likely approve a 20% rate increase for Southern California \nEdison and PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric on Tuesday, ending a \nthree-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners told Dow Jones \nNewswires on Saturday. \nThe increase also would let utilities start paying small independent power \nproducers on a forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, \nthe commissioners said. \nPG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their \nratings downgraded to junk status by Wall Street credit agencies and have \ndefaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank \nloans.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------\nLegislative firebrand Burton plays hardball in debate over power \nPosted at 9:53 p.m. PST Sunday, March 25, 2001 \nBY HALLYE JORDAN \n\nMercury News Sacramento Bureau \n\n\nSACRAMENTO -- It didn't take long for perpetually impatient John Burton to \nsize up the conference call as a waste of time. \nTwenty minutes and four curses into the conversation, the president pro tem \nof the state Senate announced to the utility company executives, outgoing \nClinton Cabinet members and top state officials that he was putting down the \nphone -- to shave. \nFive minutes later, he stashed his Gillette Mach 3 and returned to the phone. \nAs he suspected, ``I didn't miss a thing.'' \nWelcome to the world of John Lowell Burton, perhaps the state's most \npowerful, colorful and combative legislator. That Burton has ascended to the \ntop rung of political power in California surprises many, and perhaps no one \nmore than Burton himself. \nThe 68-year-old product of old school San Francisco politics has a penchant \nfor profanity and a demeanor that ricochets from volatile to gruff to goofy. \nHe fought a well-publicized battle against cocaine addiction that threatened \nto end not only his political career but his life. Burton not only survived, \nhe thrived -- a die-hard liberal somehow succeeding in an age of centrism. \nHe has prevailed in part by balancing the two sides of his political persona: \nthe idealistic progressive and the pragmatic deal-maker. \nIdealistic though he may be, Burton has a healthy appetite for hard-ball \npolitics. He's been known to abandon longtime supporters in favor of economic \nspecial interests when it was politically expedient. He has a knack for \nfundraising that makes political reformers blanch. And he delights in \njousting with the state's moderate Democratic governor, Gray Davis. \nIn his fourth year as Senate president pro tem, the second most powerful post \nin Sacramento, Burton is up to his gold wire-rims and gray-flecked eyebrows \nin the debate over rolling blackouts and energy industry bailouts. \nThe crisis has proved vexing for the veteran pol. Consumer groups are among \nhis most ardent supporters. Yet Burton feels compelled to find a way to keep \nthe lights on -- even though that means helping the cash-strapped utilities \nthat consumer groups love to hate. \nIt hasn't been easy. On Thursday, he showed his frustration with the \nutilities during a Senate debate: ``I hope they go bankrupt. Let them go \nbelly up. I don't care anymore.'' \nEarlier in the session, Burton introduced a bill that would set up a state \npower authority to help finance construction of new power plants. Another \nbill he pushed would authorize the state to purchase electricity lines from \nits cash-strapped utilities for at least $7 billion. \nThe subject of ongoing negotiations between the utilities and Davis, the \ntransmission line deal is intended to give taxpayers a valuable asset while \nhelping utility companies stay on their feet. ``If you go broke,'' Burton \nsaid, ``you sell your car or you hock your watch.'' \nRepublicans see Burton's plan as yet another example of big government run \namok. \n``He has that basic philosophy that says government wants to run \neverything,'' said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. \nBurton grew up on the outskirts of the Sunset district in San Francisco, the \nyoungest of three boys. His mother was a no-nonsense woman who, when her \nhusband refused to buy her a fur coat or a car, worked two jobs to purchase a \nmink and a used blue Buick convertible. \nHis father was a doctor who practiced in poor neighborhoods and instilled in \nhis sons a gnawing need to help those less fortunate. \nHe is obviously his parents' child: The closets of his Potrero Hill home are \nstuffed with suede jackets and tailored slacks that he regularly rotates into \nthe back seat of his car, where they are within easy reach in case he passes \na homeless shelter or some suffering soul on the street who looks his size. \n``My whole thing is caring for people on the edge that nobody gives a \n(expletive deleted) about,'' Burton said. \nSubtle, he is not: During the height of the debate over welfare reform, he \nchided his peers for slashing welfare benefits by introducing a bill that \nwould have made it a crime to be poor. \nBurton believes his party has sold out the disenfranchised in its quest to \ncapture the moderate middle. \n``Who stands for anything anymore?'' he sputters with an expletive. ``What's \nwrong with making sure all kids have medical insurance?'' \nHe seems to revel in his reputation as the only lawmaker willing to take on \nthe state's centrist governor. Their clashes are frequent, and Davis' staff \nkeeps a wary eye on Burton. \nLast year, Davis proposed a scholarship program to reward high-achieving \nstudents. Fearing the plan would siphon money from an existing program that \nprovides scholarships for poor students, Burton and a bipartisan group of \nsenators linked Davis' proposal to one expanding scholarships based on \nfinancial need. \nThat meant both would become law if Davis signed either one. Burton said the \nbill was the brainchild of all, but it bore his name for one reason: ``I \ndidn't want the governor to (expletive deleted) with it,'' he said. Davis \ndidn't. \nBurton followed in the footsteps of his oldest brother, Phillip, a powerful, \nlegendary congressman who died in 1983. \nJohn Burton spent 10 years in the Assembly and was elected to Congress in \n1974. He served eight years before cocaine addiction forced him out of \npolitics and into a Scottsdale rehab clinic. \nAt some point, Burton said, he just got sick of doing drugs in any of the \ndozens of anonymous Washington, D.C., hotel rooms he called home. \n``Finally,'' he said, ``it seemed to make a lot more sense to get some \ntreatment than be dead, or have a breakdown, or be in jail.'' \nHis drug days return only in occasional dreams in which the cocaine \ninevitably gets stuck in a straw or spills on the carpet. \nToday, Burton's lone addiction is caffeine -- he regularly downs at least \nfour cappuccinos in the morning, insisting on extra-firm foam. And he may \nhave three Diet Cokes, each with a slice of lemon, during dinner. \nFor six years after his drug rehabilitation, Burton lived in San Francisco, \nstaying straight, playing racquetball, sunning on the deck of his home with \nits sweeping vista of the downtown skyline. \nHe indulged in movies and made good money as a corporate lawyer. He also \nplayed the stock market, accumulating wealth he pegs at $1.5 million, but \nthat financial disclosure statements indicate ranges between $1.7 million and \n$7.2 million. \nFrom Gap Inc. to Wal-Mart, Burton's portfolio is impressive, if incongruous: \nThis self-styled voice of the common man owns stocks in huge pharmaceutical, \nhigh-tech, communications and oil and gas companies. \nBut his stock holdings are no more surprising than the fact that attorney \nBurton, the champion of consumer issues, was once on retainer for Pacific Gas \n& Electric Co. \nIn 1988, politics came knocking again. Burton's old Assembly seat was open, \nand his pal, then Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, desperately needed allies to \nhelp squelch rebel Democrats who were challenging his control. \n``No (expletive deleted) way,'' Burton replied three times before finally \nrelenting -- and winning. \nEight years later, he was elected to the Senate. Two years after that, his \ncolleagues chose him to serve in the state's highest legislative post, Senate \npresident pro tem. \nWhile his personality and political instincts helped win him the spot, \nanother asset propelled Burton to victory: His ability to raise boatloads of \ncampaign cash. \nHe turns even chance encounters into potentially profitable conversations. In \nearly December, a friend who ran into Burton in a San Francisco restaurant \nmentioned that he'd dropped off a Christmas gift at Burton's office. The \nsenator didn't skip a beat. ``Is it cash?'' he asked with a quick grin. \nEven people who detest Burton's politics tend to like the man. \nThe Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition said there isn't a \nlegislator he disagrees with more on hot-button topics such as gay rights and \nabortion. Still, he can't help but enjoy sparring with Burton. \nNo `stuffed shirt' \n``He's not a stuffed shirt,'' Sheldon said. ``He doesn't double-talk you.'' \nTwice divorced, Burton met his first wife in 1963 at a meeting in the home of \nVince Hallinan, the famed San Francisco civil rights lawyer. She was the \ndaughter of a labor leader who organized plantation workers and longshoremen \nin Hawaii. Married for seven years, they had one daughter, Kimiko Burton, the \nacting San Francisco public defender. He remarried in 1975, and divorced in \n1981. \nThese days, as he makes his way through the Capitol, Burton often plays the \ngracious flirt, chatting up female lobbyists and colleagues. The next moment, \nhe might be blowing up at someone, yelling four-letter words that echo down \nthe high-ceilinged corridors and force staffers to keep his office doors shut \nso as not to offend touring school children. \nState Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Los Angeles, once joked that Cal-Tech had \ndeveloped an ``FPM'' scale for the number of obscenities Burton spews per \nminute. ``More than 50 FPMs,'' she said, ``and John is really, really mad. \nLess than 10, check his breathing.'' \nBeneath the bluster is a shrewd politician who can grasp the high points of \nthe most complex subjects, instruct his staff to figure out the details and \nseal the deal with his word. As one pundit put it, Burton is the guy who \ncan't read a map, but never gets lost. \nConsider 1998, Burton's first year as Senate leader. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson \nand the Republicans wanted to slash the state's hefty vehicle license tax as \na way to share California's $4.4 billion budget surplus. But Burton and the \nDemocrats wanted to earmark the money for the needy who had taken cuts during \nthe recession. \nBurton's staff devised a plan to phase in the tax cuts over several years, \nbut only if the state was rolling in money. That protected revenues for the \nDemocrats' pet projects, while giving Wilson bragging rights to a huge tax \ncut. \n`Safe' seat for a liberal \nBeing a larger-than-life liberal in the nation's most liberal city provides a \nsense of security that few other politicians enjoy. Burton hasn't faced a \nserious political challenge since the 1960s, and occupying a ``safe'' seat \nallows him to carry controversial, special-interest bills -- even when they \ntick off his core supporters. \nBurton paid scant attention when environmentalists opposed his efforts to \nmake it easier to fill in the San Francisco Bay for runway expansions at San \nFrancisco International Airport. He shrugged off criticism about a bill he is \ncarrying that would benefit a large campaign donor who owns an out-of-state \ngambling facility. And he alienated campaign finance reform advocates by \npushing a campaign contribution and spending limits initiative that they said \nwas too permissive. \nConsumer groups chafed at one of Burton's first legislative responses to the \nenergy crisis: using $400 million of taxpayer money to buy electricity for \nthe cash-strapped utilities. Still, they turn to Burton. \n``Every morning when I get up, for the last two months, I say a little prayer \nfor John Burton,'' said consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield. ``If there is \ngoing to be one hero in this four-year deregulation debacle, it's going to be \nJohn Burton.'' \nThose who watched Burton pull back from the brink of self-destruction and \nstage his political comeback have seen him work magic before. They hope he \nhas one trick left to solve the energy mess. Burton says the crisis is the \nmost daunting political problem he has faced in his long career. \n``I don't think I have the power or the ability to put the toothpaste back in \nthe tube,'' Burton said with a shrug. ``But we're working on it.''\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nWeb of power intrigue alleged \nMany say generators shared data on the Internet to exploit the market. \nMarch 25, 2001 \nBy KIMBERLY KINDY\nThe Orange County Register \nPower producers selling electricity to California's fledgling deregulated \nmarket shared confidential data that allowed them to watch one another's \nevery move - giving them leverage to drive up prices and helping to launch \nthe state last spring into its energy crisis, records and interviews show. \nThe information provided a picture of the state's electricity grid in motion: \nThe amount of electricity being generated, price bids for electricity, the \nlocation of units down for repairs, schedules of electricity delivery over \ntransmission lines, and the location of transmission bottlenecks. \nIt was all done over the World Wide Web. \nMost of the Web sites have been shut down, amid allegations that the \ninformation was used to \"game,\" or manipulate, the electric market and gouge \nCalifornians out of billions of dollars while bringing the state's largest \nutilities to the brink of bankruptcy and prompting rolling blackouts. \nAt least one site remains, and negotiations to resurrect another \ncontroversial site are under way, frustrating consumer groups and antitrust \nlawyers who contend the power producers have found new means to collude, \nusing state-of-the-art computer technology. \n\"Openness and willingness to share information was turned against us and used \nto manipulate the market rather than to bolster the market,\" said consumer \nadvocate Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network. \n\"It's a lesson that is going to cost billions of dollars.\" \nThe data sharing began as a way to ensure the smooth operation of the state's \nelectrical grid, by giving timely information to all the people in the \nmarket: power producers, utilities, those operating the grid. \nIn recent weeks, federal and state regulators have accused the power \ncompanies of charging too much and manipulating the market. \nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 13 power generators to \njustify their prices or pay nearly $70 million in refunds. \nIt also accused two producers with Orange County operations of creating \nscarcity and gouging by as much as $10.8 million. \nLast week, the California Independent System Operator, which manages three- \nquarters of the state's electricity grid, filed a complaint with federal \nofficials alleging that 21 power producers overcharged the state by $6.8 \nbillion since May 2000. \nPower producers have routinely called the investigations \"witch hunts\" and \nbelieve they will conclude with officials seeing that normal market \nconditions - not market manipulation - led to the high prices. They say the \ndata from Web sites were used to help manage their work and design trading \nstrategies -- all legally. \n\"It's no different from putting together a weather forecast,\" said Randy \nHickok, man aging director of California assets for Duke Energy Corp. \n\"You use the information to determine your trading strategy.\" \nLive data feeds on output, transmission \nA review of a dozen studies and investigations into California's electricity \nmarket, coupled with interviews with more than 20 economists, antitrust \nexperts, Web site designers, power merchants and utility officials reveals a \nkey flaw in the market: It hinged on instant communications over the \nInternet. \nBy the summer of 1999, three main Web sites were online and being used by the \npower producers. \nOne was operated by the Western Systems Coordinating Council - which includes \npower merchants from 17 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico. The \ncouncil oversees the smooth flow of power around the West. This private site \nwent offline in October 2000. It provided live data that showed the most \ndetailed information available on generation and transmission of electricity. \nThe site might be revived. The council has paid for a new software package to \nget direct feeds from power producers, and talks are under way. \nAnother private, now-defunct Web site, which was run by the exchange that \nuntil January organized California's hourly energy auctions, provided live \ndata showing energy up for auction, bidding prices, and when the bids were \naccepted. \nStill another site - The Open Access Same-Time Information System, or OASIS, \nprovides data for the day- ahead market that shows how much capacity is \navailable on transmission lines so generators can figure out what paths to \nuse to deliver electricity. \nThe OASIS site still provides data about bottlenecks that can affect prices. \nHowever, this has caused less concern because it can't be acted on \nimmediately. It's only used for bids for the next day's market, and by then \ncongestion could be cleared. The Web sites offered rows of numbers in charts \nand tables. The power traders downloaded the data into computer programs that \nspit out maps of the electricity grid that were updated every few seconds. \nTraders could view the maps as they bought and sold energy off the \ntrading-room floors - expansive rooms loaded with computers, scrolling \ntickers and huge televisions tuned to the Weather Channel. \nThe California Power Exchange, which held the energy auction, in April 1998 \nidentified five merchants that were dominating the market. They were Williams \nCos., Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc., Sempra Energy and Duke. \nThe question at the heart of a series of state and federal inquiries is \nwhether the power producers conspired or colluded to fix prices at inflated \nrates, or whether market conditions prompted them to mirror one another's \nbidding strategies. \nPrice-fixing is illegal, a violation of federal and state antitrust laws, \nwhich were established to ensure that fair competition drives the price for \ngoods and services. \nNo smoke-filled rooms, lawyer says \nSan Diego attorney Mike Aguirre and another team of lawyers, suing on behalf \nof the city of San Francisco, say the Web sites were a new kind of collusion, \nmade possible by two things: a market dominated by just a few players, and \ntechnology that allowed those players to view the same live data in the same \nformat. \nAguirre said they knew this would make it possible to take the same actions \nto drive up prices. The Web sites were part of the plan, and it worked, he \nsaid. \n\"They are now marching lockstep and communicating in the way a cartel \ncommunicates, only they are actually much more sophisticated - you aren't \ngoing to catch them together in some smoky room,\" said Aguirre. \nBy the time the two main sites were shut down because of complaints that they \nwere being used to drive up prices, the generators had a lock on the market \nand understood the nuances of how to manipulate it, he said. The Independent \nSystem Operator believes the Web site data were used last summer to \"exercise \nmarket power and (for) gaming in the real market.\" The accusation was made in \nan Oct. 10 letter to owners of the coordinating council Web site. \nState power grid officials said they routinely saw power producers triple \ntheir prices within minutes of a bottleneck on a transmission line. Kellan \nFluckiger, the grid's operations vice president, likened it to a closure on a \nstate highway that might give businesses - that know they are the final stop \nfor bread or water - the incentive to mark up prices and take advantage of a \ncaptive clientele. \n\"We saw generators on the right side of the congestion change their bids from \n$50 a megawatt(-hour) to $150 immediately after there was a clog in the \nline,\" said Fluckiger. \nAnother strategy to create price spikes, according to grid manager Jim \nDetmers, was to intentionally pull generators offline to create scarcity. \nReliant Energy Vice President John Stout said neither his company nor his \ncompetitors used the Web site data to fix electricity prices. \n\"There are two sides to this. On the one hand you can say that people were \nable to quickly start up their generators to keep the lights on,\" Stout said. \n\"On the other hand you can say that someone kept generators offline to \nextract more money. But that didn't happen. Shutting down a generator when \nthere's an opportunity to sell energy isn't a wise thing to do.\" \nUtility executives - who bought power from the generating companies - have \nfought for the live data to be restricted to those responsible for managing \nthe transmission lines. For everyone else, they want it embargoed for a week \nor more. \n\"A delay should be enough to prevent real-time action - using the information \nto create congestion or to take advantage of bottlenecks - but would allow \nfor analysis later,\" said Gary Stern, director of market monitoring and \nanalysis for Southern California Edison. \nConsumer groups say they are shocked the live data were being shared, because \npower merchants have fought the release of the information to regulators \ninvestigating the market. \n\"The mantra of the energy industry is, 'All this information is protected as \na trade secret. Regulators, the government, the public can't see any of it \nbecause it would give competitors too much information,' \" said consumer \nadvocate Doug Heller. \"But internally the companies seem to be more than \nhappy to share and have access to crucial market data as a tool to manipulate \nthe market.\" \nSouthwestern University law professor Lawrence Sullivan, a national antitrust \nexpert, said antitrust cases are tough to prove. Sometimes there is no \ncollusion, just a group of individuals or companies presented with similar \nconditions, all reacting in the same way. He uses a rainstorm analogy. \n\"Suddenly it starts raining; you put your umbrella up and so does everyone \nelse,\" said Sullivan. \"You are acting for you own reasons and you don't care \nif anyone else puts their umbrella up. You are doing it for yourself.\" \nEqual data sharing in 'transparent market' \nFrom the regulators' perspective, the only requirement on data-sharing is \nthat it be done equally, so that all market participants can take advantage \nof it. Moreover, the federal commission actually requires the OASIS site. \nCommissioner William Massey said the economic principle driving the \ncommission's philosophy is that sharing information, or having a \"transparent \nmarket,\" should foster healthy competition. But Massey concedes California \nhas too few players and not enough electricity to have a truly competitive \nmarket. \nStanford University economist Frank Wolak - who does market surveillance \nstudies for the grid operator - said people expected that federal regulators \nwould protect consumers by setting price caps if the market became unwieldy, \nallowing flaws in the market to be worked out. \nHe blames federal regulators rather than generators. \nGenerators' \"job is to maximize profits. It's like asking a predator not to \nseek its prey,\" said Wolak. \"Lions are supposed to eat zebras, but the game \nwarden is supposed to do something if they are eating too many zebras. FERC \nhas an obligation to do something if the prices are going to kill the \nCalifornia economy.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------\nStudies show pitfalls in power market \nInvestigators believe the deregulated system has opened itself up to \nmanipulation of supply and pricing. \nMarch 25, 2001 \nBy KIMBERLY KINDY\nThe Orange County Register \nNearly a dozen studies and investigations have found evidence of flaws and \nweaknesses in California's deregulated electricity market that - if detected \nand rooted out earlier - could have prevented the state from spiraling into \ncrisis. \nA growing number of lawmakers, energy regulators and academic experts believe \npower producers exploited these weaknesses to \"game\" the market. \nEarlier this month, the state Senate formed an investigative committee to \ndetermine if energy producers illegally manipulated the market. The move came \nless than a week after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered power \nproducers to refund nearly $70 million for energy sold in January, unless \nthey can justify the prices charged. In other words, for the first time the \nonus is on the generators: They must prove they didn't manipulate the market. \nState Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who will chair the new investigative \ncommittee, has reviewed piles of evidence collected against the power \nproducers and believes it's time to determine whe ther Californians have \nbecome victims of a new energy cartel. \n\"Not only is there a grassy knoll, there are many who believe the gunman is \nstill standing there firing,\" said Dunn, an attorney who has successfully \nlitigated against the tobacco industry for engaging in unfair business \npractices. \nThe market flaws that allowed for manipulation include: \nThe \"crazy auction.\" That is how Gov. Gray Davis described the state's daily \nenergy market when the crisis hit. The auction guaranteed that every seller \nwould get paid the last bid price. The model was supposed to encourage power \nproducers to bid early to avoid being locked out when the utilities had \nenough electricity lined up. But sellers never did fill the energy needs \nearly in the day, so by the time the market was about to close, buyers had \nincreased their bidding price in an effort to secure enough energy. As a \nresult, the sellers were always awarded the highest bid price - even if 90 \npercent of the energy had been secured at a lower rate earlier in the day. \nLack of generation. The California Energy Commission says the state's \nconsumption grew by no more than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000, leading many to \nargue that scarcity alone could not have driven the market so out of control. \nHowever, economists say it may have contributed to the problem. Here's why: \neven with the commission's projections - which are disputed by generators who \nplace increases at closer to 20 percent - the rate of consumption was nearly \nequal to the rate of generation. Economists say a healthy market for \nratepayers will only come when generation exceeds consumption by at least 20 \npercent. \nInstant updates. The ability to see real-time, market-sensitive information \nallowed power producers maximum potential for com mand ing the highest \npossible price. Two Web sites in particular allowed generators to see what \ntheir competitors were up to, minute by minute, as they bought and sold \nenergy. The information-sharing is at the heart of two lawsuits filed against \nthe power producers, accusing them of violating antitrust laws to fix prices. \nProducers say they did nothing wrong. \nRegulatory gaps. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had the power to \nstep in and set caps to stabilize the market. The idea was to allow the \nprivate energy suppliers to make profits, but not at rates that will harm the \neconomy. The decision not to use this authority emboldened the merchants, \nresulting in increased profits from 1999 to 2000 of more than 300 percent, \naccording to consumer groups and a state Independent System Operator filing \nwith the federal commission. \nToo few sellers. Even when production levels climb, economists say, the \nmarketplace will be better served if more players are introduced. Most of \nCalifornia's energy needs have been met by five major suppliers, each having \nabout 20 percent of the state's business. Energy and antitrust experts say \nit's too easy to mirror one another's actions and form a mon opoly with a \ngroup of sellers this small. \nAbrupt shift to a new market. The state didn't build safety bridges from the \nold system to the new. For example, in other states where deregulation has \nbeen enacted, the utilities sold off their power generators, but only on the \ncondition that the new buyers sell them electricity at a locked-in, low rate \nfor the first few years. Economists say this would have helped stabilize \ncosts until the new market was established. \nDunn's committee will look at ways to restructure the marketplace so that \nprices can stabilize. But a second goal is to determine whether power \ngenerators have criminally exploited weaknesses in the marketplace. \nThe power generators say they've endured scrutiny in studies and state and \nfederal investigations, and that no proof of criminal wrongdoing was found. \n\"There have been at least nine investigations that have looked at this ... \nincluding a federal investigation,\" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director \nof the Independent Energy Producers, a trade organization for power \ngenerators. \"To date no one has concluded there is any illegal activity or \nany other kind of misconduct.\" \nBut Dunn, antitrust experts - and even the researchers -- said these repeated \nclaims by power producers and their representatives misstate what the studies \nshow. \nHere's why: The academic studies and market surveillance reports never aimed \nto prove illegal activity. Instead their goal was to determine if the Federal \nPower Act needed to be enacted by FERC. The act requires that the federal \nregulators step in when evidence of market power, or monopoly power over \nprices, is being exercised by the generators -something that nearly every \nstudy found. \n\"Their only job is to look at if the market is dysfunctional,\" said Dunn. \n\"They are not looking at it through the lens of a prosecutor.\" \nMIT economist Paul Joskow said his work shows that supply and demand \nscenarios could not possibly have led to the prices Californians have been \npaying for electricity. Market power had to be exerted, but he said he didn't \nhave the power to subpoena documents or witnesses that might have revealed \nillegal activity. \n\"My objective was not to determine if anyone engaged in illegal behavior,\" \nsaid Joskow, who conducted research that was funded by Edison International. \n\"It was designed to assist FERC ... then it was up to FERC to decide the \nimplications in enforcing the Federal Power Act, which requires that they set \njust and reasonable prices.\" \nJoskow's work showed that prices, in many instances, were twice as high as \nthey should have been. \nStanford University economist Frank Wolak, who heads a team of economists \nthat conducts regular market surveillance reports for California's main \nelectricity grid operator, said he has repeatedly found evidence of market \nmanipulation and reported it to FERC. \nIn 2000 alone, Wolak said, his work showed that market manipulation accounted \nfor an $8 billion overcharge out of the $27 billion that was paid for \nelectricity in the California market. \nHowever, no action was ever taken by federal officials. \n\"It's frustrating because they say, 'Be very vigilant in searching for market \npower,' but when we find it, they don't do anything,\" Wolak said. \"They say, \n'Oh no, that's not market power.' If they would define what market power is, \nwe would be looking for it. But I don't think they want us to find it.\" \nWolak said he believes that recent actions by federal officials - in which \nthey have ordered refunds - represent a token gesture and are a response to \nintense public pressure for them to act. So far, they've identified less than \n$80 million in potential overcharges, compared with the billions that Wolak \nand others have identified. \nOne federal commissioner agrees with Wolak. Commissioner William Massey said \nthe commission has resisted stepping in and using its authority because it \nbelieved the free market would correct itself. Massey said members are \nbeginning to intervene, but he, too, believes the actions should be more \naggressive. \n\"We have been the beneficiaries of countless market monitoring reports for \ntwo or three years now. Very sophisticated reports that have talked about the \nexistence of market power,\" Massey said. \"I think we should have heeded those \nwarnings. I think we should have done a better job.\" \nLast year, FERC did its own investigation to determine if power producers \nwere conspiring and intentionally taking generators offline to drive up \nprices. But that study - often cited by power generators as proof that they \nhave been cleared of wrongdoing - was cursory. \nFERC described the work as an \"informal investigation\" and said at the \nbeginning of the report that it did not subpoena witnesses or documents. Most \nof the work was done over the telephone with a few power plants subjected to \nscheduled inspections. \n\"That FERC study was ridiculous,\" said Severin Borenstein, director of the \nUniversity of California Energy Institute. \"They asked (the power producers) \nif they were manipulating. I guess I wasn't surprised by their answer.\" \nAttorneys who have accused the power producers of breaking anti-trust laws \nsaid they are using the academic studies to help them with their own \ninvestigations. \nBut they serve as a starting point. \nThe lawyers are looking at the evidence found by researchers - why they \nbelieved the market was being manipulated - and will subpoena the necessary \npeople and records to see if there is proof that illegal actions were behind \nthe manipulation. \n\"It's not all in one place, and it's not sitting on a silver platter, but we \nbelieve it's out there,\" said Len Simon, an attorney working on the city of \nSan Francisco's lawsuit filed against power producers. \"They (academic \nresearchers) have found evidence that these high prices are not purely the \nresult of market forces, but they have not been able to secure conclusive \nproof. That's what we plan to do.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nHeaded toward 'disaster' \nAnalysts: California fails in bid to get handle on crisis\nBy Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU \nSACRAMENTO -- Big power rate hikes. Dangerous rolling blackouts. Volatile \nutility bankruptcies. \nFor months, all were deemed nightmares to be thwarted at virtually any cost. \nYet now they all appear likely, even inevitable, according to experts who see \nCalifornia tumbling from an energy crisis into something worse. \n\"We're getting closer andcloser to a situation that could be described as a \ndisaster for the state,\" said James Swee-ney, director of Stanford \nUniversity's energy institute. \nEnergy woes are starting to hinder California's economy, the sixth largest in \nthe world. \nAt the same time, Gov. Gray Davis' 11th-hour, multibillion-dollar attack on \nthe crisis starting last winter has so sapped the state budget that \ngovernment fiscal watchdogs say it's even a potential threat to essential \nongoing programs. \nAnd despite the effort, analysts say California appears headed toward just \nwhat Davis and legislative leaders most feared -- major rate hikes that would \neat into consumers' budgets and a summer filled with rolling blackouts that \nendanger people and pummel businesses. \n\"These were the sort of things we said would happen unless the governor and \nlawmakers started taking actions beyond what they've been willing to take,\" \nSweeney said. \nBut the state's quest to ease the energy price and supply crisis amid a \ntangle of powerful, competing interests has turned into such a roller coaster \nride of ups, downs and surprises that increasing clashes and frustration are \nslowing or even derailing proposed remedies. \nBy default, experts say, the utilities may wind up in bankruptcies that throw \nthe energy crisis and California's fate largely to the federal courts. \nSigns of trouble abound: \nRolling blackouts during two spring days earlier this week were caused in \npart by small generators shutting down after utilities missed making payments \nfor months. Many view the outages, the first since January and the first to \nstrike Southern California, as a harbinger of summer woes despite attempts to \nfoster greater conservation and build power plants. \nThough there have been lurches toward an agreement, negotiators apparently \nremain substantially apart in secret talks on a state plan to financially \nrescue nearly bankrupt utilities. \nMajor stakeholders in the energy crisis, and their court cases, continue to \nthreaten the utilities with bankruptcy at any time. \nThe fiscally ailing utilities continue to seek rate increases from state \nregulators -- a move that politicians fearing voter backlash oppose but \nenergy and economic experts support as the quickest way out of the crisis. \nWith the state's bill for short-term power buys hitting $4 billion, some \nlawmakers are resisting the administration's requests for additional funds. \nThe governor, who has declared a state of emergency, has the authority to tap \nfunds on his own but fears the political fallout. \nLong-term power contracts negotiated by the state won't cover as large a part \nas hoped of California's demand for electricity until 2004, indicating that \nthe state will be forced to seek power for some time on the costly short-term \nmarket. \nMany more power generators, frustrated at not being paid by the utilities, \nmay either cease operations or start selling out of state. \nThere remains little sign that federal regulators will order tough wholesale \nprice caps, though there are now indications they may pressure generators to \nrebate some alleged overcharges. Numerous government investigations are \nlooking into allegations of price gouging. \nCritics are balking at secrecy shrouding the Davis administration's costly, \nshort-term power buys to thwart rolling blackouts, purchase of long-term \ncontracts and utility bailout talks. Officials say the secrecy is needed to \navoid skewing the market. \nSome critics say the state is failing to address natural gas supplies and \ncosts, an underlying cause of the crisis. Republican lawmakers have futilely \ncalled for a special legislative session, as was convened on power woes, to \naddress the issue. \nMunicipal utilities, including Alameda, Palo Alto, Lodi and Santa Clara, say \nthey are tired of being asked to participate in rolling blackouts. And \nthey've provided power to the grid, for which they haven't been repaid. \nNowhere recently has the tension over the crisis emerged more publicly than \nin the Legislature, where thwarting utility bankruptcies has been the mantra \nof the administration and legislative leaders for months.Lawmakers' outrage \nBut several lawmakers were outraged earlier this week as they battled \nutilities' reluctance to repay the state or small generators for power. \n\"Let'em go belly up,\" said Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"I \ndon't care anymore.\" \nSen. Debra Bowen, chair of the Senate energy and utilities committee, said \nshe felt \"the legislative equivalent of road rage\" at Pacific, Gas and \nElectric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison. \nThe utilities, trapped between skyrocketing electricity prices and capped \nretail rates, amassed $14 billion in debts that left them teetering on the \nedge of bankruptcy, unable to buy power. The state has spent $4 billion \nbrokering power sales as it works on a rescue plan for the utilities.$50 \nmillion daily \nBut negotiations on a bond-backed bailout of the utilities appear stalled. In \nthe meantime, the state is continuing to broker power sales on their behalf \nat the staggering cost of about $50 million daily. \nController Kathleen Connell earlier this week blocked what she described as \nDavis' effort to tap billions more in state money for the energy crisis, \nsaying such a transfer of funds could leave California short of cash for \nessential services such as public schools. \nSince the state started making emergency power buys in January, the budget \nsurplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said. \nLikewise, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative \nBudget Committee, has warned the Davis administration that he will try to \nblock additional funds for emergency, short-term power purchases. \nPeace wants to see the state Public Utilities Commission make progress toward \nrecovering from utilities the money that already has been spent. \nThe state budget also is being endangered by slow progress toward issuing \nbonds that are intended to repay coffers for short- and long-term power buys, \naccording to Connell. \nThe delay is due in part to action by the utilities, which are appealing a \nruling by the PUC that essentially ensures the state will be repaid. \nIn the face of myriad signs of trouble, Davis asserts that he is making \nsteady, certain progress toward solution of the crisis. \nBut Davis' aides privately acknowledge that his fate is inevitably tied to \nhis handling of the crisis.Jones'opportunity? \nA potential Republican opponent during Davis' re-election bid next year, \nSecretary of State Bill Jones, is pressing what he views as an opportunity \nbig enough to drive his campaign through in 2002. \nUnder Davis' leadership, Jones said, California is \"essentially mortgaging \nour future for our children and grandchildren.\" \nMeanwhile, consumer advocates are still threatening a 2002 initiative that \nwould overturn rate increases and any taxpayer-financed bailout of \ninvestor-owned utilities. \n\"Davis has not taken the action that is needed to solve this problem,\" said \nHarvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"Unless \nhe does, he's finished.\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nPublished Sunday, March 25, 2001 \nExperts predict summer outages Some say conserving not enough\nBy Mike Taugher\nTIMES STAFF WRITER \nFor months, the brains guiding California's approach to resolving the state's \nenergy crisis have been focused on getting through the summer. \nThey now must be wondering if they will make it through the spring. \nCalifornia was plunged deeper into crisis last week on a variety of fronts as \nauthorities escalated their claims that hugely profitable power companies are \nlargely to blame. \nTwo days of widespread rolling blackouts. Small generators shutting down \nbecause they have not been paid, and state legislators unable to agree on how \nto bring them back. Accusations that big generators have overcharged \nbillions. State officials scrambling to protect a once-generous surplus that \nis hemorrhaging. The revelation that Gov. Gray Davis' efforts to secure \nlong-term contracts for cheap electricity have so far fallen short of \nexpectations. \nAll in all, one hell of a week. \nAnd this is supposed to be the easy time of year. \nThe state's energy crisis is deepening. Positions are hardening, and the way \nout of this mess has never looked so difficult. \nBut it is the coming summer months, when peak demand for electricity will be \n50 percent higher than it is now, that is of greatest concern to policymakers \nand energy officials. \nMost experts agree that there is a bona fide shortage of electricity; \nofficial state estimates are in the range of 5,000 to 7,000 megawatts in the \nsummer, or enough to power 5 million to 7 million homes. \nThe California Energy Commission says, however, that with strong conservation \nefforts and new power plants, blackouts can be averted. \nOthers are not so optimistic. \nAn influential East Coast energy consulting firm recently estimated the state \nwill see 20 hours of outages in the coming months, but others fear it will be \nfar worse. \nOne industry representative said the number of blackouts would be in the \ndozens. And he said if high wholesale prices have shocked anyone, they could \ndouble again before summer is out. \n\"The prices are going to be more damaging than they are right now,\" said Gary \nAckerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of \nenergy generators and traders. \"I would say in the range of $500 to $600.\" \nConsider this: A year ago one megawatt-hour was going for $30. Last summer, \nwholesale prices rose to nearly $150, and that was high enough to drive the \nstate's two largest utilities to near-bankruptcy and force a state bailout. \nToday, as the state shells out $50 million a day to keep the lights on, \nprices are at about $300. \nThe reasons that experts give for the problems that California faces this \nsummer are numerous and many are well-documented. No major new power plants \nbuilt in a decade. A growing, technology-dependent population that is using \nmore and more power. Drought in the Pacific Northwest. Growing Western states \nusing the juice they used to sell to the Golden State. And now small \ngenerators are shutting down or threatening to sell out of state because they \nhave not been paid. \nBut there is also growing evidence that many of the problems are caused by \ngenerators and traders unfairly taking advantage of a dysfunctional market, \nsome analysts said. \n\"The other thing that makes this summer a little tenuous is last summer our \nexperience with generators and traders timing the market to maximize their \nprofit,\" said Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Energy \nCommission. \nBecause of mild weather last summer, the highest peak of demand for \nelectricity was actually slightly less than it was in the summers of 1999 and \n1998, when electric restructuring took effect. \nAnd yet it was not until last year that the state's wholesale electricity \nmarket went haywire. In San Diego, the first part of the state where retail \nrates were deregulated, consumer bills doubled and in some cases tripled \nwhile the state's two largest utilities began their slide toward the brink of \nbankruptcy. \nA growing number of experts now say generators and traders, beginning last \nsummer, began exercising unfair influence over a market where the margin \nbetween supply and demand is razor thin. \nA dramatic example of how that influence is exercised would be where a power \nplant owner closes a unit to decrease supply and drive prices up high enough \nto make up for lost production with sales from other units. Earlier this \nmonth, federal regulators accused two companies of doing just that in \nSouthern California during April and May of last year. \nMore common, experts say, is generators and traders offering for sale less \nthan a full supply of electricity so that the state is thrown into a \npanic-buying situation to secure enough electricity to prevent blackouts. \n\"What they are doing is perfectly legal,\" Chandler said. \"But what they are \nable to do is put just enough megawatts into the market to keep the prices \nhigh. \n\"From the standpoint of supply and demand, there's enough supply in \nCalifornia to meet demand, assuming we get this new generation on line and \nincrease energy efficiency,\" she added. \"The unknown is whether the \ngenerators and traders are going to put electricity into the grid that is not \nbeing controlled by contracts. That's the unknown.\" \nIndustry representatives vehemently deny they are doing anything but \nproducing all the electricity they can and putting it into the market. High \nprices and shortages, they say, are simply due to the tight margin between \nsupply and demand, combined with the high cost of natural gas and pollution \ncontrols. \n\"In a market that's tight, if you have power chasing itself all over the \nwestern United States, you're going to have high prices,\" said Jan \nSmutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. \n\"We're getting tired of being the public policy pi\u000fata here.\" \nSmutny-Jones and other energy officials say they are convinced they will be \nexonerated, and in the meantime they suggest investigating their activities \ncould prove damaging. \nBlaming generators, he said, could lead generators to decide the political \nand regulatory atmospheres are too unstable. \n\"The supply that California needs to work its way out of this is not going to \nshow up, or if it does show up, it will show up with a significant premium,\" \nSmutny-Jones said. \nStill, accusations of unfair market practices escalated last week when the \nstate's grid manager, the Independent System Operator, complained to federal \nregulators that generators and traders reaped $6.2 billion in excess profits. \nEven the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has been loathe to take \na strong stance in California, has recently demanded that power companies \nrefund tens of millions of dollars for prices the federal body says were \nexcessive in December and January. \n\"I think the generators have gotten smarter about how to make money in the \nmarket,\" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California's \nEnergy Institute. \nBorenstein is among those who believe generators are exercising market power. \nAlthough any given generator might own 5 percent or 6 percent of the state's \ngeneration capacity, when margins are so tight an individual company can \nspell the difference between keeping the lights on or forcing outages. \nThat gives those generators the power to force prices to go up artificially \nhigh, said Borenstein. \nBut even some of the generators' harshest critics acknowledge that the \nproblem is not confined to market behavior. \nThe shortage is real, experts say. \nAnd drought in the Pacific Northwest is particularly worrisome, since \nNorthern California relies heavily on hydroelectric dams in that region \nduring the summer, and transmission constraints will make it difficult, if \nnot impossible, to make up for that shortfall with power imports from the \nSouthwest. \n\"Any time you have more rain in L.A. than in Seattle, you're going to have \ntrouble,\" said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman at the California Independent \nSystem Operator. \nIn response to worries about what the next several months will bring, the \ngovernor has launched an intense, multi-faceted plan designed to avert \nblackouts and prevent a financial catastrophe. \nDavis and other Californians also have urged federal regulators to cap \nwholesale prices before summer. But FERC commissioners and the Bush \nadministration have been opposed to price caps, saying they don't work and \nwould drive electricity out of the western market. \nAnd to date, Davis' plans to minimize the damage this summer have not shown \nresults. His drive to secure long-term contracts has so far come up short, \nand the keystone effort to buy the transmission lines of the utilities has \nstalled. \nStill to be determined is the success of his efforts to bring more generation \non line and encourage Californians to conserve electricity at unprecedented \nlevels. \nLast year, San Diegans had the strongest incentive possible to conserve \nelectricity. They were paying the real market cost of power, and that was \ndoubling and in some cases tripling their electricity bills. \nBut San Diegans conserved only about 9 percent during that time, according to \na source at the ISO. What's more, once lawmakers recapped their electric \nrates and removed their price incentive, customers of San Diego Gas & \nElectric immediately reverted to their old levels of electricity use, \naccording to the ISO source. \nDavis, meanwhile, is counting on Californians to heed his call for 10 percent \nvoluntary reduction in usage with no price incentive at all, except that \nthose who conserve an ambitious 20 percent during the entire summer will \nreceive a rebate. \nBorenstein said the ISO's information about San Diego's electricity use last \nsummer is consistent with what he has seen, but he noted that the price \nincentive was not as clear as it might appear. \nAs soon as electric bills soared, Borenstein said, politicians began \nagitating customers to not pay their bills. \nSo consumers never really thought they were going to be punished for high \nuse. \nHe thinks it would be good to raise rates because, he said, that will reduce \nconsumption. \n\"Rate increases, unfortunately, are not at all inevitable,\" he said. \"We \ncould pay for all of this through the state treasury.\" \nEither way, he said, Californians will pay.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------\nCalif To OK 20% Rate Hike For Utils Tue - Commissioner\nBy Jason Leopold\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n03/24/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission will \nlikely approve a 20% rate increase for two of the state's largest utilities \nTuesday, ending a three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners \ntold Dow Jones Newswires Saturday. \nThe rate hike would let the state recoup money it spent buying power since \nJanuary, said the commissioners, who asked not to be named. The increase also \nwould let utilities start paying small independent power producers on a \nforward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, the \ncommissioners said.\nPUC also may approve a trigger mechanism. The move would allow utilities PG&E \nCorp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit \nSouthern California Edison additional rate increases of 5%, if needed, to \ncover future power costs. Rates could go down if the future price of power \nstabilizes, the commissioners said. \nA PUC administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed order that \ndoes not support the rate increase and end to the rate freeze. As a result, \nPUC Commission President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue an alternate \nproposal that will call for a rate increase of about 20%, the commissioners \nsaid. \nBoth proposed orders are expected to be issued Sunday afternoon. \n\"There is just no way we can extract 10 cents from a nickel,\" said one \nDemocratic commissioner, who asked not to be named. \"Unfortunately, we are \ngoing to have to grant the utilities an increase.\" \n\nSoCal Ed To Present Rate Arguments Monday \n\nThe commission is expected to hear oral arguments Monday by SoCal Ed \nexecutives regarding the company's rate stabilization plan. When first \npresented to the commission in November, the plan called for a 10% rate \nincrease. PG&E also filed a rate stabilization plan at the time asking for a \nsimilar increase. \nBoth utilities argued last November that their costs exceeded their revenues \nbecause wholesale power prices spiked during the summer. The utilities' \ncustomers' rates were frozen, but wholesale prices continued to soar, \nsurpassing the roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour and 6.5 cents/KWh rate the \nutilities were legally allowed to charge their customers. \nIn December, PG&E and SoCal Ed revised their rate stabilization plan, \nrequesting rate increases of as much as 30% because wholesale power prices \nfailed to stabilize and the utilities were getting deeper into debt. The \ncommission denied the request in January and approved a temporary rate \nincrease of 9% for residential consumers and 14% for large industrial \ncustomers. \nPG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their \nratings downgraded to junk-status by Wall Street credit agencies and have \ndefaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank \nloans. \nGov. Gray Davis was in Palm Springs over the weekend for a fundraiser, and \nhis staff was unavailable for comment. Representatives for PG&E and SoCal Ed \nwere also unavailable for comment. \nEarlier this month, Davis told Wall Street analysts that he would not allow a \nrate increase because he feared a ballot initiative by consumer advocates in \nthe state, who would call for an end to the state's deregulation law. \n\"Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in \n20 minutes,\" Davis said at a March news conference. \n\nGroup Pledges 'Ratepayer Revolt' If Prices Rise \n\nHarvey Rosenfield, executive director of consumer advocacy group The \nFoundation of Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, promised a \"ratepayer revolt\" and \n2002 ballot initiative if electricity rates are increased. Consumer advocates \nare also expected to testify at Monday's hearing about why the utilities \nshould not be permitted to raise consumer electricity rates. \nLegislative sources said the rate increase is needed so the state Department \nof Water Resources, which in January started purchasing power for the \ncash-strapped utilities, can be repaid. Moreover, the utilities can begin \npaying the state's so-called qualifying facilities for electricity. PG&E and \nSoCal Ed have not paid the QFs in full since January, and the companies owe \nthe generators about $1 billion. \nIn hindsight, one key Democratic state senator said, if the state allowed the \nutilities to raise rates in January, the DWR would not have had to spend \nnearly $4 billion from the general fund buying power. Further, said the \nsenator, who asked not to be named, the state would not have had to negotiate \na deal to buy the utilities' power lines in an effort to restore the \ncompanies to financial stability. \n\"Think about it.

Gray Davis finds himself increasingly alone in \nhis belief that the state can weather the energy crisis without significant \nelectricity rate increases. \nTop lawmakers and other key officials involved in sorting through the crisis \n-- including some of Davis' own staffers -- now believe rates need to rise, \nperhaps to double. And they said the Public Utilities Commission is likely to \nsignal that some rate increase is needed when it meets this week. \n\"I think the facts finally came out in terms of the magnitude of the \nproblem,\" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"You \nhave to get the money from somewhere -- unless you steal it or win a lottery \nticket ... I don't know how you solve this problem without (a rate increase) \nand I never really saw how you could solve it without one.\" \nThe assumptions the Democratic governor has relied on to bolster his \"hope \nand expectation\" that rates won't rise beyond the already anticipated 19 \npercent increase are rapidly falling apart. \nAs the crisis drags on, the state will have to spend far more than anyone \nexpected in January for short-term power purchases, long-term contracts and \nthe utilities' transmission lines. \nDavis had also hoped the state could strike a deal to rein in the costs the \nutilities pay alternative energy suppliers, but by week's end suppliers were \nbalking and previous legislative agreements began to disintegrate. \nOn March 7, state Treasurer Phil Angelides had recommended the state \ninitially sell $10 billion in bonds to help the state purchase power, saying \na significantly larger-scale bond issue would increase costs for ratepayers. \nThe Senate on Thursday approved a bill it thought would make that possible. \nBut by Friday, neither Republican lawmakers nor the Davis administration was \non board. \nKey lawmakers were told by high-level Davis staffers that the state may need \nto borrow as much as $23 billion -- and raise rates by as much as 60 percent \nto 80 percent above the initial 19 percent to support it -- over the next 18 \nto 24 months. \nDavis, meanwhile, was in the Palm Springs area for most of the day Friday. As \nnegotiations continued in the stalemated Assembly, Davis attended a campaign \nfund-raising luncheon at a top desert golf resort. His spokesman, Steve \nMaviglio, said the governor did not play golf, but attended the event between \na morning groundbreaking ceremony and a mid-afternoon television interview. \n\"It's insane and disgusting at this point,\" said Doug Heller of the \nFoundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"Governor Davis is unfortunately \ntending to his campaign coffers more effectively than he is tending to the \nstate's energy needs. He is double-bogeying his round as governor.\" \nOne administration source said some Davis advisers have been calling for a \nrate increase for weeks. Maviglio said Saturday that the governor has not \nbeen briefed on the most current financial models with which his negotiators \nand legislators are working. \n\"The governor has not signed off (on a rate increase),\" Maviglio said. \"What \nthe staff says doesn't matter. ... There's absolutely no change with what \nhe's said all along.\" \nBut others said it is time the governor confronted the reality of a rate \nincrease. \nOn Friday -- after his briefing with the administration -- Assembly Speaker \nRobert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said, \"it seems more inevitable that the \nPublic Utilities Commission will have to raise rates.\" \nAssemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, for months a key player in the \nenergy talks, concluded a month ago that state \npolicy-makers have little ability to influence the price and availability of \npower in the short term. \n\"Even if the governor and the Legislature acted in perfect harmony, the \nability of state government to effectuate an outcome is very, very limited,\" \nKeeley said. \"My guess is the force of events -- the enormity of the \neconomics involved in this -- are playing out and that the administration is \ncoming to the same conclusion.\" \nAngelides said the numbers suggest the state can't survive financially under \nthe current rate structure. \n\"There's a limit to how much you want to sell bonds to keep delaying \nreality,\" he said. \"At the end of the day the PUC is going to have to set \nrates that allow the state to buy power and the state and utilities to \nrecover their costs. It is certainly worth borrowing money to repay the \ngeneral fund, but then you have to ask: 'How many billions are we willing to \nborrow to delay the tough reality of where we are?' \" \nHeller, whose group vigorously opposes any rate increase, said he believes \nDavis is politically averse to boosting voters' energy bills -- but at the \nsame time doesn't want to take the steps necessary to crack down hard on \nenergy generators, such as seizing power plants or imposing a windfall \nprofits tax. \nThat leaves the Legislature little choice, he said, but to embrace a rate \nincrease as necessary. \n\"It's political suicide, but they have to be considering throwing this right \non (power) bills, and using blackouts as a mechanism to scare us into \naccepting these rate increases,\" he said. \"The Legislature appears to be the \nfall guy for the governor's weakness.\" \nKeeley said Davis could help the situation -- and perhaps be viewed as \ncourageous -- if he publicly embraced a rate increase soon. \n\"It would end the fantasy that this situation could be stabilized without a \nrate increase,\" Keeley said. \"That fiction -- and the effort to maintain that \nfiction -- gets in the way of genuine problem solving.\" \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------\nRising cost of purchasing electricity sparks alarm \nPosted at 11:00 p.m. PST Saturday, March 24, 2001 \nBY PAUL ROGERS \n\nMercury News \n\nA chorus of frustration, anger and renewed calls for the state to seize \nprivately owned power plants echoed across California Saturday, following \nnews that the state might have to spend as much as $23 billion over the next \ntwo years to buy power to keep the lights on. \n``Where do we go from here? How about off the bridge?'' said Sen. John \nBurton, D-San Francisco. \n``Deregulation has been a disaster in California,'' said Assembly Speaker Pro \nTem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz. ``Most of us didn't vote on this, but it is \nour job to clean it up. And the cleanup is going to be awful.'' \nRepublicans were equally gloomy. \n``The amount of money we are talking about now is so massive that most people \nare shellshocked,'' said Bill Campbell, the Assembly Republican leader from \nOrange. \nThe state's energy crisis reached a new level of anxiety among many lawmakers \nFriday, after top staff members for Gov. Gray Davis told legislative leaders \nthat the tab for the state to buy power over the next two years might not be \n$10 billion, a previous estimate, but could reach as high as $23 billion. \nThe new projections stem in part from the state's failure to sign enough \nlong-term contracts for low-cost energy, to move aggressively on an ambitious \nsummer energy conservation plan, and to approve a bailout for Pacific Gas & \nElectric Co. and Southern California Edison. \nSources said the governor's aides estimated the rate increase for consumers \ncould be as high as 80 percent to cover the costs. \n`Wildly speculative' \nOn Saturday, the governor's office did not confirm or deny the number. \n``There are a differing number of what-if scenarios being played out,'' said \nSteven Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. Maviglio called the $23 billion \nestimate ``wildly speculative.'' \nHe said Davis holds out hope that ratepayers might get ``billions of dollars \nin refunds'' from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The state this \nweek alleged that power companies have overcharged California ratepayers by \n$6.2 billion. \nAnd he said Davis still is trying to avoid having consumers' rates go up, \nsomething many legislators, including his fellow Democrats, now say is \nunlikely. \nDavis appeared briefly on a CNN television broadcast to discuss the crisis. \nHe did not say whether rates would have to be raised, or address the $23 \nbillion price tag. \nThe two leading choices are to raise rates for consumers or sell bonds, which \nwould be repaid by ratepayers but would cost more over time because of \ninterest. \n``It seems increasingly there isn't a will in the Legislature to finance a \nhuge debt over time,'' said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ``I would say \na rate increase is more and more likely, whether or not it is the governor's \nfirst choice.'' \nOn CNN, Davis repeated calls for consumers to conserve power by at least 10 \npercent this summer and blamed out-of-state power generators for raising \nrates to take advantage of California's flawed 1996 deregulation law. \n``They have what we need, and they are demanding very high prices for it,'' \nDavis said. ``It has driven our utilities to the edge of bankruptcy and \ncomplicated our problem.'' \nDavis took a backhanded swipe at San Jose, a city that has blocked attempts \nby Calpine Inc. to build a 600-megawatt power plant in Coyote Valley. \n``Everyone has to do their part. Cities can't be turning down plants,'' he \nsaid. \nSome were calling for more drastic measures. \nBurton, the president pro tem of the state Senate, said that having the state \nforcibly take over by eminent domain and buy out power plants across \nCalifornia, many of them operated by Texas and other out-of-state power \ncompanies, is looking more possible. \n``If these figures are right,'' he said, ``maybe we just go in and buy these \ngeneration plants. If we are going to spend $20 or $30 billion, we might as \nwell own them.'' \nA bill written by Burton to create a state power authority that could build \nand buy power plants passed the Senate last month and is pending in the \nAssembly. \nDavis broached the subject of an eminent domain takeover of power plants in \nhis State of the State speech in January. Since then he has said little about \nthe option. \nInstead, Davis has tried to fix a flawed 1996 deregulation law by having the \nstate enter into long-term contracts to buy power for PG&E and Southern \nCalifornia Edison. The two utilities say they have lost more than $13 billion \nsince last summer and now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy because they have \nbeen forced to pay high wholesale electricity costs, and California's 1996 \nderegulation law prevents them from raising rates. \nConsumer advocates on Saturday were unequivocal, however. \n``It's time to get the pitchforks and go to the Bastille,'' said Nettie Hoge, \ndirector of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``You have to put it \nat the feet of the people who are doing the generating -- the Texas and \nSouthern companies.'' \nHoge said that California residents are in for ``certain blackouts'' this \nsummer when energy demand outstrips supply. And with power bills likely to \nrise, she said interest is already high in crafting a ballot measure for 2002 \nfor the state to take over the power plants. \n``What you have is a huge black hole of generator greed. We have almost \nburned through the state surplus. Somebody has got to put on the brakes,'' \nshe said. \nPower producers, however, said that solution would be ill-advised. \n``We would vigorously defend our interests,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman \nfor Duke Energy. ``You can't seize property without fair market value. It is \nagainst the law.'' \nDuke has bought four power plants since 1998, paying $611 million. The \ncompany has already begun a $1.6 billion effort to upgrade and expand the \nplants, which include former PG&E facilities at Moss Landing and Morro Bay. \nIf the state seized the plants, long court battles would ensue. Williams said \nDuke's plants are worth far more than what the firm paid for them, and the \nstate would lose tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue. \nOpposition to seizures \nRepublicans in Sacramento have opposed seizing power plants, saying it will \ndiscourage new construction. Campbell said Saturday that if rates have to be \nraised, he favors using the state's surplus for a $6 billion or more tax cut. \nThe state Public Utilities Commission is to take up the rate hike on Tuesday. \nSo far, the PUC has raised retail electricity rates only 9 percent since the \ncrisis began. \nOne Democratic leader, Keeley, agreed that costs would be so high for the \nstate to seize power plants it might not be worthwhile. He said the state \nshould stay the course, and can get by with rate increases, issuing bonds for \nsome of the costs and continuing to permit the construction of new power \nplants. \nKeeley also said for the first time Saturday that he is no longer opposed to \nletting PG&E or Southern California Edison go bankrupt. It may be cheaper, he \nsaid, for the state to take over those companies -- and the one-third of \nCalifornia's power they produce -- than continuing to help bail them out. \nWill Davis agree to more radical notions like seizing power plants or \nallowing bankruptcy of the state's venerable utilities? \nOne political observer said he will do what the public wants, especially as \nhis re-election in November 2002 nears. \n``Gray Davis wants the lights on until the day after the election,'' said \nSherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the School of Policy, Planning and \nDevelopment at the University of Southern California. ``He is a political \npragmatist. You do what you need to do.''\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nBond may fall short, Davis aides fear\nGovernor holds out hope of keeping a lid on rates\n\nBy Ed Mendel \nSTAFF WRITER \nMarch 25, 2001 \n\nSACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis' administration is concerned that a planned $10 \nbillion bond issue may fall short of covering power costs, and some think \nutility customers will be hit with a hefty rate increase. \nBut a spokesman said yesterday that Davis continues to say his \"hope and \nexpectation\" is that the electricity crisis can be solved without an increase \nin the existing rate structure. \n\"He said there is absolutely no change in what he has been saying all along,\" \nsaid Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. \nMaviglio said the administration asked the Assembly on Friday to delay action \non a bill that would limit the bond issue to $10 billion while \"some \ncash-flow issues\" are studied. \nA Davis energy adviser, Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, said the \nadministration is studying \"various scenarios\" based on payments to small \ngenerators, long-term power contracts, the price of natural gas used by \ngenerators and the cost of buying power on the spot market this summer. \n\"We wouldn't be good analysts if we didn't vary assumptions widely on our \ninputs to try to see what comes out of them,\" Fichera said. \nMaviglio denied reports that the governor's top aides have concluded that a \nrate increase is necessary. \n\"We have one anonymous staff (member) saying that,\" he said. \"I can tell you \nfrom my meetings the whole staff isn't sold on it.\" \nThe state began buying power for utility customers in mid-January after a \nfailed deregulation plan drove Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern \nCalifornia Edison Co. to the brink of bankruptcy. \nThe rates the utilities could charge their customers were frozen as the cost \nof wholesale power soared, producing what the utilities say is a combined \ndebt of nearly $13 billion. \nThe state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month from the general fund \nto buy power, and $4.2 billion has been earmarked for power purchases so far. \nThe plan is to repay the general fund with bonds paid off by utility \ncustomers. \nThe state Treasurer's Office had hoped to obtain a $5 billion, short-term \n\"bridge\" loan by the end of this month, which would provide funds until the \n$10 billion bond could be issued at the end of May. \nThe lawmaker who carried the legislation authorizing the bond issue, \nAssemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has said from the outset that a \nrate increase is likely, despite the governor's hope to the contrary. \nNow new estimates of what the state may have to spend to buy power during the \nnext two years reportedly are as high as $23 billion. The concern is that \npaying off a bond of that size would force a substantial rate increase. \nAssembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, was pessimistic about avoiding \na rate increase as he spoke with reporters Friday after the Assembly \nadjourned for the weekend. \n\"I don't think so,\" Hertzberg said when asked if a rate increase could be \navoided. But he quickly added, \"I don't know yet.\" \nThe governor wants to use the existing rate to pay off not only the bond to \nbuy power, but a second large bond issue to pay off the massive debt of the \nutilities as part of the state purchase of their transmission systems. \nThe Public Utilities Commission may consider a proposal Tuesday to reallocate \nrevenue from the bills paid by utility customers, giving the state the \n\"California procurement adjustment\" needed to pay off the power bond. \nDavis also wants the PUC on Tuesday to order PG&E and Edison to begin paying \nsmall, non-utility generators in the federal \"qualifying facilities\" program \nthat provide about one-quarter of the state's power. \nA number of the small generators have quit operating, contributing to rolling \nblackouts early last week. Edison has not paid the small generators since \nNovember, and PG&E has only paid 15 percent of what they are owed. \nBut paying the small generators, while providing revenue to pay off two large \nbond issues, strains the existing rate structure. PG&E warned Friday that it \nmay file a lawsuit if the PUC does not leave enough of the rate revenue for \nthe utility to pay its bills. \nThe bill that would limit the power bond to $10 billion also contained a \nprovision that would no longer require that payments to small generators be \nbased on the price of natural gas, which has soared in recent months. \nSmall generators who use gas turbines oppose the change, warning that it \nwould put them out of business. A third part of the bill would cap the rates \nfor businesses served by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. \nNegotiators meeting over the weekend are expected to place the bond limit, \nthe small-generator provision and the SDG&E business-rate cap in three \nseparate bills.",

She said that they adjusted \nthe DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.

Any auctions (in\n>any commodity) that would work?  We are trying to get back to key policy\n>makers mid-day on Monday.\n\n\nYes, there are numerous default service auction models in operation or\nproposed, both in electricity and other utilities. The government of New\nSouth Wales in Australia is implementing a model similar to this. In\nGeorgia, I think they recently had an auction to serve customers served by a\ngas retailer that went bust. Similar mechanisms have been used for years in\nthe telecoms business for serving specific client bases, such as rural\ncustomers. Examples have been in Chile, and even in the U.S. (auctions for\n\"universal service obligations\").\n\nWe proposed a model for \"third-party\" default service standard supply for\nOntario (working for Aleck Dadson of Enron Canada). This allowed the\nstandard supply provider to meet its obligation by competitive means,\nincluding holding an auction. The idea was to provide customers hedging in a\nframework that allowed for competition in default service.\n\nLet me know if you want a briefing or futher info. I'll be in the office\nuntil 4:00 or so (I'm then heading to the airport for Portland).

      "content": "Bob / Mark,\n\nSince our recent discussions over the above, I have checked the situation out \nextensively with the OMLX and it appears that the best solution would now be \nthe following:\n\n1. Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (\"ECTRIC\"), the \nDelaware incorporated company, becomes  a member of the OMLX (either as a \npure Proprietary trader or as  a Market Maker - see point (a) below - Bob you \nneed to advise me what you want here).\n\n2. Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited (\"EEFT\"), the English SFA-regulated \ncompany which acts as agent / arranger for ECTRIC, then, via EEFT's staff in \nLondon, places ECTRIC's bids / offers onto the Pulpex Index in the name of \nand for the account of ECTRIC.  Acting purely in this \"arranging\" manner, \nEEFT itself would not be a member of the OMLX in any capacity.\n\n3. Please note that if Steve is going to be the EEFT person in London who \nwould place such orders onto Pulpex in the name of, and for the account of,  \nECTRIC, then Steve will need to become a \"Registered Representative\" of EEFT \nwith the SFA before he can place such orders.  As you know, this status may \neither be gained by Steve passing an examination or by certain length of \nexperience in the market.  I shall need to sort this out with Steve if you \ndecide to do this.\n\n4. Once EEFT has placed a bid / offer onto the Exchange in the name of, and \nfor the account of, ECTRIC as the Member, if that gets \"hit\", then we can \ngive-up that contract immediately to ENA's account under the Exchange's \ngive-up procedure.          \n\nPoints to note:\n\n(a) ECTRIC could join the OMLX as either a Market Maker or as a Proprietary \nTrader.  Clearly, if ECTRIC joined as a Market Maker, ECTRIC (through EEFT in \nLondon) would be obliged to make firm two way bids / offers for 2 1/4 hours \nduring market opening hours - but so would ENA out of Houston which also has \nMarket Maker status. Hence, Enron would have two sets of MM obligations, one \nwith ENA and the other with ECTRIC (through EEFT in London).  Bob - Do you \nwant this??  Or would you prefer to leave the Market Making obligations with \nENA and just have ECTRIC as a Proprietary Trader??  The Exchange (Derek \nOliver) assures me that that there is no difference in the information \navailable to MMs as opposed to Prop Traders and Prop Traders can post bids \nand offers as well as hit others bids and offers.  The only difference \ntherefore is that a Prop Trader  does not have the obligation to post bids \nand offers during market hours.  Please let me know.\n\n(b) If we go this route, the OMLX would like comfort from ECTRIC's external \nUS counsel  that ECTRIC would not be in breach of any US regulations by \nadopting the above structure.  In obtaining this advice, we shall need to \nbear in mind whether, in acting on behalf of ECTRIC, EEFT in London will \nplace orders by electronic link or  by telephonic link (as is presently the \ncase from Houston).  Mark, are you able to obtain this advice??  Please let \nme know.\n\n(c)   From discussions with Jannine of Tax Dept., there are tax implications \nto any form of trading through London for the US, although these are not \ninsurmountable.  Jannine will no doubt write you a separate e-mail with \nregard to the cost of doing such business from a Tax perspective and you \nshould bear the contents of that in mind before deciding whether or not to \nproceed.  \n\nKind regards\n\nMark",

If the business school wants to go \nforward\nwith a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one.  \nJeff\nhas said he likes the idea of coordinating.  Bill and Allen, what do you \nthink?\nI will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief\neconomist at DOJ.  As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford\neconomist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than\nanyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,\nAustralia, and California.  He speaks a mile a minute though and his\nunderstanding of policy and politics is a bit naive.\n\nI should note that ICF will not be able to contribute.  I heard from Michael\nBerg this morning.  So he will not be participating in our discussions either.\n\nMy opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school.  One positive outcome \nof\nthis would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch\neconomic policy faculty.  Overshadowing is possible.

My idea \nis to organize a 1 or 2 day seminar in S?o Paulo, having Nancy Wodka (B&P) \nand Jos, Em?lio (Tozzini, Freire) talking about international and Brazilian \nlegal issues of \"Contracting\" (focusing on PPAs and equity participation).  I \nwould also very much like to have you talking about \"Derivatives\".  \nAdditionaly, it would be interesting to have someone from EES (or V&E) to \ntalk about \"Outsourcing\".  I'd like to hear your opinions before contacting \nNancy and Jose Emilio.  Please be advised that Nancy has indicated to us that \nthe Seminar must take place in March.\n\nThanks for your cooperation.\n\nRegards,\n\nSami",

You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.  \n I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her \nand I agree with your comments. \n\nSome of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought \nmight be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option \nVolatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading \nthat is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock \nOperator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have \nread (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It \nis an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.

Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make\nour classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We\nappreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable\ncontribution.\n\nOne of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in\nthe day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited\nabout Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to\noffer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the\nmost impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is\nsufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her\nintangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working,\ndetermined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice\nperson.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would\ndescribe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads\nby example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and\nwilling to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think\nMilagros would be an asset to any organization.\n\nAgain,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can\nhelp you in any way.\n\nRegards,\n\nChip Ryan\nAssistant Professor of Finance\nE. J.

The topic of today's panel was \"RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.\"  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  \n\nPanel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\nThe morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  \n\nEnergy Spot Market\n\nThere was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  \n\nDay Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules\n\nMost of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.\n\nICAP Requirement\n\nMost of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  \n\nMark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.\n\n Standardized Markets\n\n Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.\n\nMassey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.\n\nPanel Two:  Optional RTO Markets\n\nThe afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).\n\nThis panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.\n\nMandatory Markets\n\nOther than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.\n\n ICAP\n\n Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.\n\nPat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.\n\nShelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.\n\nDay Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.\n\nPlease call me with questions or comments.\n\nSarah",

Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.\n\nWe have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses.

      "content": "Hey Becky,\n\nShannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was \nsomething I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that \nwould help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear \nyou got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your \nknee doing by the way.  \n\nI'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people \njust drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.  \nAnd if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of \nthe time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They \nfinally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's \nactually going to happen.  \n\nYou'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean \nI been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one \nperson should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple \nof months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna \nhear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of \nsentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit \nblowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk \nto them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in \nthe office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really \ninteresting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying \nto me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living \nsomewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the \ninterview, much less to live up there.  \n\nHas Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too \nbright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really \nis smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer \nthan me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we \nreally have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when \nwe're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of \nOctober when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for \nThanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious \nthat there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's \nbeen kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review \neach other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone \nwe work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's \nsaid anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It \nreally wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and \nhe and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the \nquestions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  \n\nWell my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but \nsending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to \nhear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  \n\nRobin",

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a public \nnotice (see attached) regarding certain pleadings that were filed for \npurposes of requesting emergency relief for qualifying facilities (QFs).  The \nFERC's Notice states that Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) submitted a Request \nfor Emergency Relief and an Updated Request for Emergency Relief, on March 8, \n2001 and April 9, 2001, respectively, requesting the FERC to take action to \nprevent QF capacity from going off-line in the State of California.  \nRidgewood asks the FERC to take actions that will permit those QFs in \nCalifornia that have not been paid fully for past power deliveries to enter \narrangements to temporarily sell to third-party buyers within California.  \nRidgewood asks the FERC to declare that California electric utilities cannot \ndeny transmission access to QFs or otherwise frustrate the ability of QFs to \nsell to third-party purchasers.    \nSimilarly, the California Cogeneration Council (Cogeneration Council) on \nApril 9, 2001, filed a Motion for Emergency Relief requesting the FERC to \ntake action to prevent QFs from going off-line in the State of California.  \nThe Notice states that, among other things, the Cogeneration Council requests \nthe FERC to require interconnection, transmission, and related services under \nsection 210(d) of the Federal Power Act on a temporary basis pending the \nresolution of  accounts receivable issues. The FERC will address the \nCogeneration Council's motion and the responses thereto in the proceeding \nestablished for the Ridgewood filings.\nThe FERC is also instituting a proceeding under Section 210(d) of the Federal \nPower Act on its own motion.  In this proceeding, the FERC will consider \nwhether and to what extent it may need to order the provision of \ninterconnection, transmission, and related services under Section 210(d) to \nalleviate generation capacity supply shortages in California.\nPleadings in response to the FERC's Notice are due by May 10, 2001. \n2.  Edison Mission Energy (EME) has submitted a filing at the FERC seeking \nauthorization for an internal reorganization.  The filing states that the \npurpose of the proposed transaction is to permit Edison International (EIX) \nto obtain financing needed to meet its near-term obligations as well as \npotential obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) negotiated \nwith the State of California.  The proposed transaction involves the creation \nof a new intermediate holding company (NewCo) between EIX' direct subsidiary, \nThe Mission Group, and The Mission Group's subsidiary, EME (the new holding \ncompany will acquire all of the common stock of EME).  NewCo will secure new \nfinancing, using its EME holdings as collateral, and dividend proceeds of the \nfinancing up to The Mission Group, who will transfer the funds to EIX through \na loan.  NewCo will establish a separate corporate structure so that it is \nstructurally remote from a potential bankruptcy of EIX.  EME has requested \nthat the FERC authorize the restructuring by May 14, 2001.  EME states that \nEIX' current credit facility matures on May 14 and that additional \nobligations come due in July and November 2001.  In addition, it states that \nEIX' cash requirements in 2001, including its MOU obligations, are expected \nto exceed its cash distributions from subsidiaries.  The FERC issued a public \nnotice of the filing, which provides that any pleadings in response the \nfiling be submitted by May 10, 2001.\n3.  The Independent Energy Producers Association held a press conference to \npresent their report \"Powerful Ideas\" - which offers solutions for rebuilding \nCalifornia's troubled electricity market.\n4.  This morning, Governor Gray Davis' staff hosted a conference call to \nupdate the financial community on the Governor's plan to address the ongoing \nCalifornia energy crisis.  Overall, Joseph Fichera with Saber Partners and \nfinancial advisor to Governor Davis, said that the Governor's goal is to \nprotect ratepayers and the California economy.  He added that the Governor \nwants to focus on rates, as well as increasing energy supply.  The Governor's \ngoal is to have a stabilized power market and 20,000 MW online by 2003.  \nFichera said that the Governor's plan is the best option available for \ndealing with the crisis and that the only other alternative is bankruptcy \nreorganization.\nThe Governor's plan, which Fichera described as \"detailed and complex\", uses \nthe Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") entered into with Southern California \nEdison (\"SCE\") as the template for future agreements with other utilities.  \nThe MOU requires legislative, regulatory and administrative actions to be \ncompleted in order to be successful.  On the legislative side, the Governor \nwill send proposed legislation to the California legislature later today or \ntomorrow.  At this point, no decision has been made regarding sponsorship of \nthe legislation or whether or not the bill will be introduced into the \nAssembly or the Senate.  On the regulatory side, Fichera said that the \nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\") already has begun to \nimplement portions of the MOU using their normal rulemaking processes.  \nFichera hopes that the CPUC will be able to complete its necessary actions in \nJune or July.  Finally, on the administrative side, the Governor's staff is \nmoving forward with SCE in negotiating and documenting the definitive \nagreements that are necessary to implement portions of the MOU.  These \nagreements are required to be completed by 15 August 2001.\nWith respect to the other utilities, the Governor is in the final stages of \nnegotiations with San Diego Gas & Electric and expects an agreement to be \nreached within the next two weeks.  Fichera also said that PG&E \"remains on \nthe radar screen,\" and that the Governor believes that the successful \nimplementation of the SCE plan as detailed in the MOU will result in PG&E \ncoming out of bankruptcy faster.  The Governor's representatives have met \nwith the Unsecured Creditors Committee and their representatives to review \nthe financial information in the MOU and the implementation plans.  Fichera \nsaid that he hopes that PG&E \"will seize the opportunity\" to take advantage \nof the proposal on the table.  He also urged the \"Wall Street community to \nspeak with PG&E to convince the company's management to return to the \nnegotiating table in order to emerge from bankruptcy sooner rather than \nlater.\"\n5.  Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante filed suit against  five power generators in Los \nAngeles Superior Court alleging the generators conspired to drive up \nelectricity prices and that the five companies gained control of the state's \npower market and used unlawful trading practices to manipulate prices.  The \ngenerators named in the suit are Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Mirant Inc., \nReliant Energy Inc. and Williams Cos.  \n6.  SDG&E filed suit against three power generators in San Diego Superior \nCourt, alleging that the generators illegal shut their plants down during the \nstate's power crisis.  SDG&E is asking the judge to order the generators  to \ndeliver electricity during peak periods this summer.   The companies are \nSithe Energies, Applied Energy and Energy Factors.  \n7.  A judge in Riverside County denied the request of Corona Energy Partners \nLTD, a QF, to be released from its PPA with SCE. \n8.  U.S. Rep. Doug Ose, R-Calif., is introducing a bill to increase \nhydroelectric power in the West. The bill would allow the U.S. secretary of \nthe interior or the secretary of the army to waive restrictions on federal \ndams to address an emergency electric power shortage declared by a governor. \nOse says the bill would give hydroelectric dams more flexibility and would \nhelp provide power when demand rises this summer.  \n <<QF Emergency Relief - FERC Notice.txt>> \nRegards, \nPaul Aronzon (paronzon@milbank.com) \nRobert Moore (rmoore@milbank.com) \nEd Feo (efeo@milbank.com) \nAllan Marks (amarks@milbank.com) \nFred Neufeld (fneufeld@milbank.com) \nKevin McSpadden (kmcspadden@milbank.com) \n <<...>> \n  www.milbank.com  \nThis e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential \ninformation.

Part 1 (b) - this is where we will specify the Threshold Amount for\ncross default to other debt (Section 5(a)(vi) purposes.  Please note that\nthe definition of Specified Indebtedness in the ISDA is very narrow.  Let\nMark Taylor know if that needs to be amended.  Alos, let Mark know if the\ncross default language itself needs to be amended to match the Supply\nAgreement.  OK.  I HAVE A DEFINITION OF MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS THAT WILL WORK \nFINE FOR SPECIFIED INDEBTEDNESS.  I MATCHED THE CROSS DEFAULT IN THE SUPPLY \nAGREEMENT TO THE ISDA, BUT WITH THE BROADER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS LANGUAGE.\n\n2.   Part 1 (h) - this section contemplates adding Additional Termination\nEvents.  I had thought that here we would add a cross default to the\nTransaction Documents.  Mark will need input from you on what those are.\nAdditionally, it would be here that we would add some of the other trigger\nevents that are currently in the Supply Agreement.  Again, Mark will need\nyour input on what those are.  OK.  WE WILL DEFINITELY NEED TO CROSS DEFAULT \nTO THE SUPPLY AGREEMENT.  I'LL COORDINATE WITH MARK.\n\n3.   Please look at the language in sections 5(a)(vii)(bankruptcy) and\n5(b)(iv)(credit event upon merger) of the ISDA form and advise Mark as to\nwhether any changes need to be made to conform with what is in the Supply\nAgreement.  I GENERALLY CONFORMED THE SUPPLY AGREEMENT TO THE ISDA FOR THESE \nEXACT SECTIONS; HENCE ONLY MINOR MODIFICATIONS (E.G. \"MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS\") \nWILL BE REQUIRED TO CONFORM THE ISDA.\n\nI'm assuming that the other parts of the schedule will be agreed to by\nthem.  Please note that in Part 1(e) we have chosen the \"Loss\" method as a\nmeans for calculating the termination payment.  In Part 3, these are the\ndocs that we usually get but if the Supply Agreement requires something\ndifferent, particularly with respect to financial info, we can modify\naccordingly.    In part 4, we have chosen arbitration and Texas as\ngoverning law.  Part 5 is mostly boilerplate, but note the \"setoff\"\nlanguage and the \"transfer\" language, which they may comment on.  part 6 is\nboilerplate.  I'LL NEED TO REVIEW THIS.\n\nMark's number is 853-7459.  I'll be back Wednesday afternoon. OK.\n\nCarol St. Clair\nEB 3889\n713-853-3989 (Phone)\n713-646-3393 (Fax)\ncarol.st.clair@enron.com",

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\n\nIndeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.  Its the right thing to do.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLeah Huddleston",

      "content": "Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.\n\nPrimary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.\n\nWe have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.\n\nAccess to the Enron Center\n\nOver the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):\n\n?\tAs employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.\n\n?\tEmployees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). \n\n?\tVisitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.\n\n?\tVisitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.\n\n?\tVisitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.\n\n?\tEmployees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing \"tail gating\" by others.\n\nThese will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. \t\n\n\nTravel Advisory Update\n\nWith the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:\n\n?\tWhile the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.\n\n?\tFor non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her \"registration\" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for \"registration\" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.\n\nWe will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.",

To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.\n\n<<TW Rev By K Date.XLS>> \n\n -----Original Message----- \nFrom:   Hayslett, Rod  \nSent:   Wednesday, November 21, 2001 8:43 AM \nTo:     Lokay, Michelle \nCc:     Corman, Shelley \nSubject:        FW: Additional TW information request \n\nDo you know where I might be able to get this kind of information? \n\n -----Original Message----- \nFrom:   Hayslett, Rod  \nSent:   Wednesday, November 21, 2001 8:16 AM \nTo:     Geaccone, Tracy \nCc:     Moore, Jan \nSubject:        FW: Additional TW information request \n\nTracy:  I need your help.

We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. \n\nThis information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for \"reverse synergies.\"  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.\n\nI don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  \n\nPlease let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  \n\nJayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.   \n\nThank you, \nSarah \nx36214 \n << File: TW model 11.20.xls >>",

      "content": "PennFuture's E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication  concerning \nthe current themes and trends in the energy market.  \n\nOctober 4, 2000\nVol. 2, No. 20\n?\nElectricity\u0001,s Oktoberfest\n?\nPennsylvania retail market survives summer and  grows\nThe latest shopping statistics on Pennsylvania\u0001,s market show  that as of \nOctober 1, more customers than ever have switched to a competitive  supplier \nin Pennsylvania. Up from the 528,000 customers that had switched by  July 1, \nnow more than 551,000 customers have chosen competitive suppliers. This  \nincrease in customers that have switched is impressive given the unfavorable  \nsummer wholesale market conditions. Even more impressively, in Duquesne Light\u0001,\ns  service territory, 33% of residential customers have now switched. \nNineteen  suppliers are competing for residential customers in the PECO \nservice territory.  New Power entered the PECO market in September and is \naggressively advertising  and marketing, including offering frequent flyer \nmiles to its customers. Do not  expect that any of this good news will make \nheadlines around the country. But  count on those that support the California \napproach to restructuring (they are  still peddling their snake oil) to keep \nmisrepresenting Pennsylvania\u0001,s electric  competition policy and bashing \nPennsylvania\u0001,s market.\n?\nMack and ECAP re-enter the green market \nThe Energy  Cooperative Association of Pennsylvania (ECAP) and Mack Services \nhave re-entered  the green power market in the PECO Energy service territory, \noffering a 100%  Green-e certified renewable energy product for 6.37 \ncents/kWh. A typical  residential consumer would pay a mere 14 cents more per \nday to purchase a 100%  renewable power product from one of these suppliers. \nMack and ECAP join Green  Mountain Energy Company, which continued to accept \nnew customers throughout the  summer, as the three suppliers offering Green-e \nproducts in the PECO area. Green  Mountain also has dropped the $3.95 per \nmonth customer service charge in the  PECO service territory, thereby cutting \nthe cost of its 100% renewable energy  product by more than 10%. This is a \ngood time to switch to these attractive  renewable energy products, which \navoid an amount of pollution equal to not  driving 20,000 miles,? taking 1.7 \ncars off the road, or planting 950 trees.  See our website at \nwww.pennfuture.org  for a switching kit.\n?\nNew investment for Green Mountain\nThis week Green  Mountain Energy Company announced that it has received a \n$53.5 million  investment from Nuon, the largest utility company in the \nNetherlands. Nuon joins  BP Amoco with significant stakes in Green Mountain \nEnergy. Sam Wyly also  announced that he was resigning as the Chairman of \nGreen Mountain Energy\u0001,s Board  of Directors.\n?\nHopefully the new investment and board membership are preludes to more  \nmarketing activity in Pennsylvania for renewable energy products.\n?\nAdversity to triumph\nIn another striking development in  the renewable market, one of \nPennsylvania's early modern-era renewable  generators will most likely stay \nin business, despite the recent ending of a  long-term PURPA contract. Since \n1985, the Lebanon Methane Recovery project has  been operating effectively to \nconvert into electricity the landfill methane that  would have gone directly \ninto the atmosphere. After the 15-year PURPA contract  ended last year, the \nfacility was not able to sell its output in the PJM  wholesale market at \nprices high enough to stay in business. Its closing was  imminent when \nPennFuture was first contacted. The plant will likely now remain  open as \nPennFuture arranged a project that will keep middleman expenses to a  \nminimum. The methane generator will sell directly to Mack Services Group, a  \nlicensed wholesaler and retailer which will sell a 100% renewable Green-e  \ncertified product to an aggregation of churches in the PECO service \nterritory.  By averting the shutdown of the facility, this project directly \navoids the  emission of methane \u0001* a greenhouse gas that is four times more \npotent than  carbon dioxide (CO2). The generation of electricity from this \nproject also  produces approximately 141 fewer tons of nitrogen oxide, 472 \ntons less sulfur  dioxide, and 57,000 tons less CO2? than are emitted by the \ngeneration of  average system power.\n?\nLebanon Methane and Mack Services have agreed to price the transactions so  \nthat a reasonable profit is made, while selling at a price that enables most  \ncongregations to save as much as 10% off the price they would pay for mostly  \ncoal and nuclear generation from PECO. Adding more small renewable \ngenerators  and additional congregations may expand this project in the \nfuture. \n?\nAllegheny Energy joining PJM?\nAllegheny Energy,  operating in Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and West \nVirginia, must by October  15th inform? FERC and the Pennsylvania Public \nUtility Commission (PUC)  about which Regional Transmission Organization or \nIndependent System Operator  that it will join. Important legislators like \nRep. Tulli and key regulators like  the PUC have been sending the \nunmistakable message that Allegheny Energy would  be well advised to join \nPJM. Last month, on the verge of briefing the PUC about  its ISO plans, \nAllegheny Energy was told not to come to Harrisburg unless it was  going to \ngive two thumbs up on PJM. No car from Hagerstown, MD headed northeast  that \nday. If Allegheny Energy does become part of PJM, Duquesne Light would  \nlikely follow suit. Expanding PJM to cover western Pennsylvania is vital to  \nPennsylvania\u0001,s economy and future. Encouragingly, officials in Harrisburg  \nincreasingly understand the importance and urgency of this matter. \nHopefully,  Allegheny Energy also understands the determination to ensure \nthat PJM expands  to include western Pennsylvania.\n?\nTrouble blowing in the wind\nRecently Allegheny Energy  was asked to provide the same energy scheduling \ntreatment for a proposed wind  farm in Fayette County that is accorded to a \nsimilar wind farm now operating in  neighboring Garrett, Somerset County. The \nGarrett wind farm is located within  PJM and its need for scheduling \ntreatment that reflects the intermittent nature  of wind power has been \naccommodated by GPU and PJM. Allegheny Energy refused to  provide the same \ntreatment given to the Garrett facility and, as a result, has  certainly \ndelayed the project and put at risk the income to farmers, local tax  \nrevenues, good jobs and clean energy which the nearly 15 megawatt wind farm  \nwould create. The primary reasons Allegheny Energy gave for its refusal were  \nthat its control area is too small and that it lacks a liquid spot market. \nGuess  what? Both problems would vanish if Allegheny Energy joins PJM. The \nonly glimmer  of hope for avoiding an unfortunate regulatory fight is that \nAllegheny Energy  said it would discuss this matter further after October \n15th. Let\u0001,s hope for all  concerned that the ides of October bring glad \ntidings.\n?\nDuquesne POLR II collaborative to begin October 14\nThe  recent decision by the Pennsylvania PUC to send the Duquesne POLR II \nproceeding  to a collaborative commences with the first session October 14th. \nThe  collaborative is expected to wrap up in November. At stake is the most \nambitious  and successful retail choice transition of any EGS in the U.S. \n(see E3, Vol. 2,  No. 18, Sept. 11). The Duquesne plan would increase present \nshopping credits by  31% on a system average basis as well as provide a 17% \nsystem average and 21%  residential rate cut for customers, whether or not \nthey are shopping. Between  the rate cut and savings from shopping, \nresidential customers may be able to  reduce their rates by 36% when compared \nto those in effect prior to competition.  Among a host of other issues, \nparties to the collaborative are now raising the  issue of Duquesne's \nmembership in PJM. Presumably, if Duquesne's transmission  assets are moved \ninto PJM, then Orion's generation bundle will also be in PJM.  If Allegheny \nand First Energy were to join PJM, Duquesne's membership in PJM  would bring \nall Pennsylvania generation mWs into the same ISO. \n?\nGPU\u0001)First Energy merger\nIn another ISO-related  decision, First Energy, part of the flawed Alliance \n\"ISO\" filing, will file  their merger plans with FERC and the Pennsylvania \nPUC this month. First Energy,  as a possible Alliance member, is not slated \nto join a fully functioning ISO for  some time. The GPU merger gives First \nEnergy a chance to join PJM. This would  expand PJM\u0001,s geographic coverage to \nToledo, Ohio. Whatever the reason for First  Energy\u0001,s delay in joining PJM, \nit is not for lack of cash flow or merger  synergies. First Energy\u0001,s \npresentation to Wall Street on the GPU merger notes  that in their previous \nmerger, 1997's Ohio Edison-Centerior union, First Energy  promised synergies \nof $1 billion and states that it has already delivered $700  million, with \n$350 million/year in annual recurring savings. The presentation  tells only \nhalf the story: First Energy's promise to the Ohio PUC in that merger  was to \njoin a functioning ISO. That promise now can be kept with First Energy  \njoining PJM.\n?\nLittle known fact about PECO shopping credits\nA recent  analysis of seven churches in the PECO service territory showed \nthat, because of  usage variations and the demand factor charge, shopping \ncredits ranged from 5.33  to 10.69 cents/kWh. Looks like a good opportunity \nfor savings in green  power.\n?\nICAP update\nAs high as $350 mW/day, this past summer\u0001,s  ICAP prices were due \nsubstantially to de-listing of capacity resources for sale  into neighboring \npower pools. The de-listing of capacity resources can explain  why ICAP \nprices skyrocketed this summer, when daily energy prices were lower  than \nexpected, as were year-ahead energy prices in the forward market. The  impact \nof de-listing on prices and reliability was discussed in a recent PJM  Future \nAdequacy Working Group (FAWG) meeting, where it was revealed that  de-listing \ncould have presented a problem had demand in PJM been consistently  high. \nDespite the FAWG acronym, even with a north-Jersey accent there is no  cloud \nin this group's direction: Most forward-looking participants expect that  the \nde-listing market maneuver will be limited by a requirement that ICAP be bid  \nonce or twice a year (with a daily market for changes in ICAP \nresponsibility).  This way, if a generation owner decides to de-list his \nresource to chase higher  energy prices in other markets, the owner foregoes \nICAP for a full year or most  of the year (if the commitment period is \nsemi-annual as opposed to annual).  Beyond this fix for next summer, we \npredict that the FAWG will embrace the  elimination of ICAP for 2002. \n\nE-cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications.  \nAuthors are available for print or broadcast.\n?\nPennFuture, with offices in Harrisburg, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, is  a \nstatewide public interest membership organization, which advances policies \nto  protect and improve the state\u0001,s environment and economy.

It is my understanding that last Friday a line tripped, due to the wind generation according to John Adams at ERCOT.\n \nWhen you say keep an eye on transmission, what do you mean?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Bolton, Stacey \nSent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 3:41 PM\nTo: Curry, Mike; Gilbert-smith, Doug\nCc: Twiggs, Thane; Ryall, Jean; Ring, Richard; Mainzer, Elliot\nSubject: REC fees/TX transmission\n\n\nI'm hearing that ERCOT is backing off from ever invoking a fee for the REC program.   If you recall, ERCOT was going to take up this issue again at the end of year -- after initially suspending invoking any fees.  With the REC program up and going, ERCOT has determined that the fees to operate the program are not as high as initially projected.  We're hearing that in January they will likely permanently roll all the fees associated with running the REC program in with the overall market administration fees.   This is good news.\n \nWe need to keep a close eye on the transmission, though.  If there are transmission constraints and congestion getting the wind power from West Texas, this will likely bump up the cost.\nStacey Bolton\nEnvironmental Strategies\nEnron Corp\n713-853-9916 direct \n713-303-2632 cell \nsbolton@enron.com <mailto:sbolton@enron.com>",

I briefly \ndiscussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them \nbefore the group for possible discussion on our next conference call. \n\nWhen I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that \nthe categories of requirements might be able to be divided into \"regulatory\" \nresponsibilities vs \"commercial\" requirements.  In the regulatory column \nwould be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual \nidentification of the CEO.  Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed \nevery 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart)  Other \nitems such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax \ncontributions might fall into the commercial category.\n\nThese requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but \nthere is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated \nwith them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications.  And \nare there penalties in place if we don't comply?  \n\nScott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n   Lara Leibman                08/23/2000 01:42 PM\n\nTo: Sue Nord/HOU/EES@EES, Donald Lassere/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Bolton/Enron \nCommunications@Enron Communications\ncc: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Marchris Robinson/HOU/EES@EES, Steve \nMontovano/DUB/EES@EES, Susan M Landwehr/HOU/EES@EES, Jeff \nDasovich/SFO/EES@EES \nSubject: IXC vs. CLEC\n\nAttached please find a chart that summarizes the differences between IXC and \nCLEC obligations for Texas, New York and Illinois.

Officials deny price gouging.\n\n\t\nBy DOUG SMITH and RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS\n\n\nDuring the peak of California's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged, according to a newly completed independent audit.\n\nThe document, obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act, seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes.\n\nThe audit also undercuts efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private, out-of-state generating companies. For months, DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15% above its costs.\n\nAs recently as July, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, repeated that assurance in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown.\n\nBut the audit findings show that DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56% last year under Freeman's stewardship.\n\nOverall, during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, records show that the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million. It says it is still owed $180 million.\n\nBeyond those higher profits, the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity.\n\nThey include a $34-million cut for the city's general fund--essentially a bonus for the utility's owner--and an additional $42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency's capital investments.\n\nThese overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators.\n\nIn effect, unsuspecting ratepayers across the state, whose utilities have been battered by debt, are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay.\n\nIn an interview late last week, Freeman defended those costs and DWP's profits, saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants.\n\nHe insisted that he had issued \"standing orders\" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15%.\n\n\"We made a fair amount of money. It was not price gouging,\" said Freeman, who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year.\n\nFreeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15%, then \"I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at [the] DWP.\"\n\nThe DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs, said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freeman's tenure.\n\n\"Maybe in hindsight,\" Wiggs said, \"it would have been better not to be so specific, but to say, 'Look we're gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers.' \"\n\nStill, Wiggs said, even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. \"We charged just and reasonable rates,\" he said, adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin.\n\nWiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity.\n\nConducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the study targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000. The results have provided critics with new ammunition.\n\n\"Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair,\" said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union. \"This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks, savings and loans and insurance companies--not a public agency.\"\n\nSen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the crisis, was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWP's profits were limited to 15%.\n\n\"This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny,\" he said after learning of the audit. \"It would be ironic if it turns out that the L.A. Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov. Davis' 'Texas Pirates,' \" said Thompson.\n\nThe DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the state's deregulation of electricity began to backfire, with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding.\n\nTo keep the power flowing, the DWP--which had opted out of deregulation--cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market.\n\nThis helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced.\n\nAt the same time, however, the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis, official reports would later show. Freeman repeatedly said the utility's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly, inefficient plants.\n\nBut the audit raises such serious questions about the DWP's behavior that the matter has spilled into the 2002 gubernatorial contest.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a possible Republican challenger to Davis, last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure.\n\nIn a letter to his successor, James K. Hahn, the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling.\n\nIf so, he said, the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated $180 million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales.\n\nA Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity.\n\n\"The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales,\" said Jaime de la Vega, a senior advisor to Riordan's campaign committee.\n\nFreeman, now squarely in the Davis camp, disputes Riordan's account. He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agency's pricing strategy.\n\nHe wanted to charge more, according to Freeman, in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, which were slipping into insolvency.\n\nFreeman described Riordan's view as: \"If we're gonna continue to sell it to them, we ought to get a lot of money. He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it.\"\n\nFor the most part, the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in California's haywire energy market. Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market, including his agency.\n\nBut according to a report by the state's grid operator, DWP was one of the most aggressive, along with the trading arm of BC Hydro, the government-owned utility in British Columbia.\n\nYet another report--this one by the state's power-buying agency--found that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe report said DWP charged an average of $292 per megawatt hour, asking more than many private generators.\n\nIt could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher.\n\nEven after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year, the DWP collected profits more than 40% higher than it claimed to have netted, records show.\n\nOverall, during the 13-month period audited, profits averaged 29%, double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving.\n\nAlthough Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers, Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities.\n\nOne key question is whether those agencies, like private suppliers, should be forced to refund excess profits.\n\nThe primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged.\n\nDWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction. But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities.\n\nThe leading proponent of that course is state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).\n\nIn a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month, he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are \"merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies.\"\n\nThe chairman of that committee, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead.\n\n\n State Faces Crunch Time to Deal With Electricity Costs\n* Energy: With one week left in the legislative session, lawmakers and regulators want to resolve questions on how California will recoup its expenditures during power crisis.\n\nAfter a summer of delays, California regulators and legislators are aiming in one final week to resolve issues crucial to millions of electricity customers and the financial stability of the state and its utilities.\n\nThe energy crisis that caused blackouts early this year has receded, but it has left behind a potential fiscal crisis. The state needs to recoup more than $8 billion that it has spent on power, and it has signed $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts.\n\nFinal plans for meeting these financial obligations--and spreading the pain of paying them off--have been debated for months. But the decision time has come: Legislators are scheduled to recess for the year on Friday, and the state Public Utilities Commission is under pressure to act on several long-pending measures at a meeting on Thursday. \"What's before the state, both at the PUC and the Legislature, is how are we going to provide power to people in the years to come,\" PUC President Loretta M. Lynch said in an interview. \"Are we going to have a healthy utility to provide the power, or are we going to rely on the state?\"\n\nThe PUC, which approved the biggest rate increase in history earlier this year, now faces another tough choice: Should it surrender its formerly ironclad authority over electricity rates to the state Department of Water Resources, an agency that has come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest and the cost of its contracts? Or should it balk and jeopardize the state's planned sale of bonds to replenish the treasury and repay loans?\n\nLegislation on Related Issues\n\nLegislators are grappling with two complicated and highly contested bills on related issues. One seeks to repair the finances of Southern California Edison through a $2.9-billion aid plan backed by Gov. Gray Davis. The other would limit the powers of the Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for 10 million customers of Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric since January.\n\nThe state law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power exempted the purchases from PUC reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges.\n\nNow, the department is seeking a formal agreement with the PUC that would guarantee that its cost of supplying power to utility customers will be fully covered. Critics say the accord is a blank check for future rate increases, but the department says no increases will be necessary in the foreseeable future.\n\nState officials say the PUC has little choice but to sign the agreement, which they see as necessary to reassure Wall Street bankers that the Department of Water Resources will be able to repay $12.5 billion in bonds the state plans to sell to cover power costs. The money from those bonds will go, in part, to repay the state treasury for money laid out for power.\n\nTop state officials, including the governor and treasurer, want the bond sale to go without a hitch, but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months, and threatened litigation could further delay it.\n\nThe urgency over the bonds comes about because the state already has used $6 billion from the treasury and has taken out a $4.3-billion loan to cover power costs.\n\nState Treasurer Phil Angelides said that if the bonds are unsold and the economy slows down next year, the state could be revisiting the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.\n\n\"People ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question: What is the best and fastest way to repay the state general fund to ensure critical programs such as education and health get their funding?\" he said.\n\nLynch, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member PUC, finds herself in a particularly difficult position. She sees the value of PUC reviews of the reasonableness of power purchases. But, Lynch said, \"If we do not enter into a rate agreement, the bonds do not issue and that could affect the state general fund.\"\n\n\"The thing I care about most,\" she added, \"is ensuring the general fund is repaid.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Lynch issued a draft decision that would have the PUC essentially rubber-stamp any future revenue requests or rate increases sought by the Department of Water Resources. But she also has publicly endorsed a bill by state Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco) that the Davis administration opposes.\n\nThe bill would ensure that the PUC has the right to scrutinize the revenue needs of the Department of Water Resources and hold public hearings. It would not, however, give the PUC the power to disallow department expenses. To reassure Wall Street, the bill would dedicate a portion of the money that utilities collect from their customers to repaying the bonds.\n\nAt a PUC meeting last Thursday, PUC commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque, appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson, voiced support for the Burton bill, saying it would let the PUC shed additional light on the Department of Water Resources' power-related expenditures.\n\nThe Davis administration opposes the bill's present form but is seeking amendments. One concern is that energy providers would sue out of fear that if money runs short, bondholders would be paid before they are.\n\nThe bill's passage could be a \"deal breaker\" for the bond sales, said contractor Joseph Fichera, a financial advisor to Davis.\n\nAt the least, contentious debate surrounding energy-related issues could drive up the price of floating bonds, Fichera said.\n\n\"Wall Street does not like risk. Conflict implies risk. So the more we create, the more we are costing ratepayers,\" he said.\n\nThe Legislature also is considering a bill that would allow Edison to sell bonds to pay off about three-quarters of the debt it accrued during the energy crisis. The utility would have to handle on its own about $1 billion owed to large energy companies. Consumer activists have threatened a ballot initiative to block the bill, which they call a bailout.\n\nThe PUC on Thursday is scheduled to vote on several items designed to ease the sale of the Department of Water Resources' bonds. One is a rate increase for SDG&E customers. Another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider.\n\nThe Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, an organization that includes many large California businesses, said its members would be forced to sue if the PUC goes ahead with plans to retroactively void the right of customers to choose their own energy providers.\n\nBut the most controversial item has been the proposed PUC agreement with the Department of Water Resources. Consumer groups and utilities alike have called for public examinations of the department's contracts and revenue requirements.\n\n\"The plan would allow a state agency to operate behind closed doors while it negotiates with ratepayers' money,\" said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"Secrecy in DWR leads to conflicts of interest and that leads to higher rates.\"\n\nConcerns about the Department of Water Resources' lack of independent oversight have been heightened by recent developments:\n\nEnergy experts have questioned the qualifications of the trading team the department assembled, and several traders were fired for alleged conflicts of interest.\n\nCritics seized on reports that the department sold surplus power at a loss of $46 million in July, although officials say surpluses are bound to occur with long-term power contracts.\n\nAnd the department's projections of its revenue needs for future power purchases have been updated and amended twice, prompting utilities and others to question the reliability of the figures.\n\nPG&E Threatens to Sue Over Revenue\n\nThe utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years. If the PUC does not provide for that, lawsuits could be coming.\n\nPG&E, which already is in bankruptcy, has threatened to sue if the Department of Water Resources' revenue requirement doesn't leave the utility a sufficient share of the rate increase adopted by state regulators in March.\n\nPG&E recently asked a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to require the Department of Water Resources to hold public hearings on its revenue requirements. The company has reacted angrily to a draft PUC decision to shift $600 million of the state's cost of buying power from Edison to PG&E, saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against PG&E customers.\n\nDavis aides have defended the Department of Water Resources and its power purchases, saying the department's long-term contracts helped cool the energy crisis.\n\n\"They look overpriced now,\" Fichera said. \"But four months ago they were underpriced [compared with the spot market]. They are an insurance policy\" against market volatility.\n\nHaving the PUC review actions of another state agency would be redundant and would serve no purpose, Fichera said, because the contracts already are in place.\n\n\"You can't break contracts,\" he said. \"You've got to pay them.\"\n\nEven some critics acknowledge it is difficult to evaluate the Department of Water Resources' performance to date. One reason is that the department has closely guarded details about its contracts and its spot purchases, arguing that release of too much information would place it at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nAnother reason is that market conditions have changed and natural gas prices have declined since the department entered into contracts amid the energy crisis.\n\n\"We all have 20-20 hindsight,\" said PUC Commissioner Bilas. \"When DWR entered into contracts, the state was over the barrel. Now we can say that they are not as good as [the department] thought . . . and that DWR does a lousy job of negotiating contracts. But that's unfair.\" \n\n\nGreen energy sources seen as ripe for growth\nBy Carrie Peyton\nBee Staff Writer\n(Published Sept. 10, 2001) \nWind and hot water, sunshine and rotting garbage. \nThey all could keep California's lights on -- for a price. \nAround the state, more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the state's power roller coaster. \nThis week, Sacramento's municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious 10-year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on non-hydroelectric sources of renewable electric power, such as wind farms and solar panels. \nIn the Legislature, a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of \"green\" power, rising to 20 percent of their portfolios by 2010. That would roughly double current supplies. \n\"This may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed,\" said state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, author of SB 532. \nMore than a dozen states and many nations already have \"portfolio standards\" that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources. The amounts can be as low as 2 percent or 3 percent, or as high as 30, partly depending on what gets called \"renewable.\" \nEnvironmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea, saying it would bring a constellation of advantages. \nThe air would be cleaner, they say. Finite resources such as coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly. And in California, the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas, the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants. \nBut free-market advocates and some utilities are dubious. \nThey worry that a state-mandated portfolio standard would drive up prices. It could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own. And in the push to diversify from natural gas, critics of such standards don't want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources, including coal, nuclear power and new large dams. \n\"Ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted, and I think not considering nuclear options within the state, at least giving it some public hearing, is shortsighted,\" said Karal Cottrell, a Sacramento Municipal Utility District director. \nIt is a debate that will help shape California's power future, and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants. \nJust over half of in-state electricity production now is fueled by natural gas, but that could rise to 65 percent by 2010 if all currently proposed gas-fired plants are built, said Mark Bernstein, an energy analyst at RAND. \nLong viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean, natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the state's power picture. \n\"We have a very hard time predicting the price of anything, particularly energy these days,\" said Bernstein. \"What happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up?\" \nThat fear has been sobering for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays: hydro power, with its risks of short supplies in dry years, and natural gas. \nAlready considered a leader in renewable power, SMUD gets about 7 percent of its electricity from non-hydro renewables. In a series of workshops beginning Tuesday , it will seek public feedback on a proposed 10-year plan that would raise that amount to 10 percent by 2006 and 20 percent by 2011. \n\"If we commit to this, this will be the largest renewable commitment, I believe, in the state right now,\" General Manager Jan Schori told directors. \nRenewable power would cost more, but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it, said SMUD planning chief Jim Tracy. His proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatt-hour for renewables. \nAt first, SMUD plans to expand its Solano County wind farm, continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the Kiefer landfill plant, which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage. That should get the utility close to 10 percent. \nBy 2003, staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase: boosting green power another 10 percent at a livable price. \nThe likeliest cost-effective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power, said Tracy. \nThat's also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the Legislature adjourns Friday. \nWind turbines -- once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity -- have become bigger, more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade. Aided by a federal tax credit, they now can supply power at between 3 cents and 6 cents a kilowatt-hour, depending on location, according to the American Wind Energy Association. At its lower end, that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant. \nGeothermal power, tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water, runs between 4.5 cents and 7 cents a kilowatt-hour, and could go lower if it, too, qualifies for the next round of federal credits, plant developers say. \nBoth sources of power are plentiful in California. \nThe state is the 13th best source of wind in the nation, with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state. \nGeothermal power already makes up 5 percent of the state's supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts, with rich beds in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped. \nBy comparison, solar power costs more than 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity. \nBoth wind and geothermal could be \"a shoo-in\" economically if natural gas prices float higher, said Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs. \nToday, it's also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard. \n\"We think the standard is going to save consumers money, or in the worst case, it's like an insurance policy,\" said Freedman. \"I think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days.\" \nBut with only a week left to go, Freedman said, \"the enemy of (Sher's) bill is time.\" \nThat's actually just one of the enemies. \nOthers include Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., and the California Manufacturers Association, which fear it would boost electric rates. \n\"When a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible, is this really a good time for this?\" asked Sempra spokesman Ed Van Herik. \nBoth Sempra and the Assembly's Republican caucus point out that more than $100 million a year already is collected from consumers' electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy. \nThe portfolio standard could have Californians paying again -- up to the 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour cap in the bill -- for power that they've already helped subsidize, they say. \n\"Renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own,\" said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth, R-Temecula. \"To artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation.\" \nCalifornia already gets about 9 percent of its total energy supply, including imports, from non-hydro renewables, and an additional 3 percent from small hydro. The state Energy Commission predicts that current programs could boost that to 17 percent by 2006. \nSo to Sher, author of the renewables bill, raising that amount to 20 percent by 2010 is actually a modest goal. \n\"We're well on our way there,\" he said.\n\nDan Walters: As Davis and Burton spar, big Capitol agenda remains unsettled \n\n\n(Published Sept. 10, 2001) \nThere's no scientifically objective method of measuring such things -- the world still awaits the invention of a procrastimeter -- but it's evident that as the final week of the 2001 legislative session begins, there are an extraordinary number of pithy issues left to be resolved. \nAlthough procrastination is a Capitol perennial, what's different his year is that so many of them are significant matters of public policy that cannot simply roll over into 2002, including major pieces of the energy crisis puzzle such as Gov. Gray Davis' bailout of Southern California Edison. \nAlso on the pending agenda are redrawing legislative and congressional district boundaries, multibillion-dollar bond issues for schools and colleges, a slew of labor benefit bills that business leaders call \"job killers,\" a drive by trial lawyers to make it easier to open up confidential lawsuit settlements, consumer protection measures that include those affecting privacy and \"predatory lending,\" expansion of rights for gays and undocumented immigrants, community college support and a potentially sweeping measure to expand health care access for the state's huge uninsured population. \nWhy has so much been left to the final hours? Some of it is human nature compounded by political skittishness. But the extraordinary amount of serious legislating left to the last minute this year reflects both the unusual circumstances of this year's session, especially the energy crisis, and an escalating conflict between the Capitol's two most powerful Democrats, Gov. Gray Davis and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton. \nThe first half of the year was utterly dominated by the energy situation and then by a partisan conflict over the state budget as California's economy softened and revenues dipped sharply. Other legislative matters drifted until summer's heat enveloped the Capitol. \nThe more important factor may be the Davis-Burton feud which manifests itself in many ways, but particularly on the two most important pieces of late-session business, the Davis-sponsored Edison bailout and a multibillion-dollar boost in benefits for workers with job-related illnesses and injuries, carried personally by Burton. \nAs it happens, the price tag on each is similar. The Edison measure would authorize the utility to issue $2.9 billion in bonds to repay its debts and, at least in theory, step back from the brink of bankruptcy. The workers' compensation bill, sent to Davis' desk last week, would boost benefits by a similar amount each year. Burton has denounced the Edison bill as a raid on ratepayers while Davis has in the past vetoed similar workers' compensation measures, and is being urged to do it again by employers, who list it at the top of their \"job killer\" bills. \nThe two politicians have so much prestige on the line with the two measures that there have been recurrent rumors of a squeeze play in which Davis would have to agree to sign the workers' comp bill to get his much-cherished Edison bailout, although no one will say so publicly. \nThe Burton-Davis conflict, however, is far broader than these two bills. They represent, in effect, the two faces of the Democratic Party -- Davis the cool, business-friendly centrist and Burton the passionate, labor-oriented liberal -- and their personal relationship is practically nil. Burton openly despises Davis as a betrayer of party principle and trashes him to anyone within earshot. Davis is more circumspect, but those around him contend, in effect, that if liberals like Burton had their way, the Democratic Party would again become anathema to moderate voters and Republicans would regain their prominence in the state. \nOne reason for this year's delays is that a huge wad of liberal legislation -- including many bills that Davis doesn't want to see on his desk -- is backed up and Burton could, if he wishes, dump it on the governor and make him decide whether to offend business or Democratic interest groups. \nIt is, therefore, a game of chicken. Will Burton protect Davis from being caught in the middle by holding up the key bills and/or agreeing to modifications, or will he let the governor sweat?\n\nCal-ISO Violating Fed Law By Making Utils Buy State Pwr\n\n09/10/2001 \nDow Jones Energy Service \n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) \n   (This item was first published late Friday) \n \n   By Jason Leopold \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n   \nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California 's grid operator may be in violation of federal regulations by forcing utilities to buy expensive power the state secured under long- and short-term contracts in place of electricity that is available from their own low-cost power plants. \nThe California Independent System Operator, the agency that operates the real-time electricity market and maintains reliability of the grid in the state, has given priority during the past three months to power the state Department of Water Resources locked in under the $43 billion of long-term contracts before utilizing electricity from low-cost power plants, according to several executives at the agency. \nGreg Fishman, an ISO spokesman, said \"there are times, this doesn't happen much, when because of varying ramp rates, we take a bid out of sequence, meaning when one plant has a bid of let's say $50 a megawatt-hour and another has a $60 bid, we may take the $60 bid because it would take longer to deliver the $50 power.\" \nFishman said the \"market is not working as it is designed to.\" \n\"Since the demise of the California Power Exchange, we, the industry, have been forced to make the market function given the tools that we have,\" Fishman said. \"The PX was a major portion of the market. Without it, we are left trying to put the market back into shape given the current players in the market.\" \nHowever, the ISO's federal tariff states that the agency must use the cheapest electricity available in the wholesale market before dispatching the more expensive electricity to generators and retail customers. \n\"The ISO shall dispatch generating units...to meet its imbalance energy requirements based on order of energy bid prices,\" reads a section of the rules approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \"The ISO shall not discriminate between generating units, system units, loads and system resources other than based on price and the effectiveness (location and ramp rate) of the resource concerned to respond to the fluctuation in demand or generation.\" \nFishman acknowledged that the \"market is not working as it is designed to,\" but he said the ISO would not respond to specific questions related to the possibility that the agency has violated its federal tariff or other issues related to the operation of the ISO market. \n\"We are looking into a variety of issues surrounding that dysfunction and in due course we will answer those issues,\" he said. \n \n   Agency Fails To Reveal Price Data For DWR Power \n   \nMoreover, the ISO has failed to disclose on its web site the price of the DWR power, which is also required under federal regulations. \nJan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, a trade group representing large and small power producers, said there is \"absolutely no transparency in the ISO market. No one knows what they're paying for.\" \nThe DWR, which started buying power in lieu of California 's ailing utilities in January, signed $43 billion in long-term supply contracts over the past six months at prices that now exceed the spot market price for electricity . \nThe DWR at times has had a surplus of electricity and has sold some of it into the spot market at a $115 million loss over the last three months. As a result, the ISO has ordered the Mohave Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant in Nevada capable of producing electricity at roughly 2 cents a kilowatt-hour, to reduce output at the facility, Fishman said. \nThe 1,500-megawatt Mohave unit is majority owned by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison. \nFishman said last week that the ISO is investigating the circumstances that led the grid operator to order the units to \"ramp down.\" \n\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE -- BLACKOUTS SHED LIGHT ON UPS ADVANTAGE \nScott Campbell\n\n09/10/2001 \nComputer Reseller News \nPage 78 \nCopyright (c) 2001 CMP Media LLC \nSo much for the California power crisis. \nSolution providers spent much of last winter and spring installing uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes) because of anticipated rolling blackouts. But a mild summer on the West Coast put those fears to rest. \nIn fact, power companies in California even sold excess energy to neighboring states. Still, heightened awareness of the earlier energy crisis helped solution providers, say executives. \n\"Everybody's got blackout scares. That's where we position ourselves,\" says Henry Ngo, marketing manager at e-Systems Design, a Brea, Calif.-based solution provider. \"We go out to enterprise-level accounts and we talk about rolling blackouts, power surges and the backup power they need. They're worried about losing data and jeopardizing their whole network infrastructure.\" \nAlthough major outages haven't occurred recently in California , the power-protection business remains steady. In many cases, UPS-driven leads have translated into profitable service opportunities, Ngo says. \n\"[Selling UPSes gives us a chance] to fish for the integration portion-maintenance services, design, network assessment-for future projects,\" Ngo says. In the past two months, e-Systems has taken on about 10 UPS deployments in enterprise accounts, he says. \nSources at the Energy Information Administration say demand for electricity is expected to increase 2.4 percent nationwide this year over last, while generating capability will increase only 1.4 percent. In California , energy consumption is expected to increase 3.1 percent this year, according to the government agency. \nWhile other regions don't face the same problems as California , solution providers see plenty of opportunity to deliver UPS solutions across the United States. \nThe combination of daily thunderstorms, old buildings and Louisiana heat and humidity led Software & Stuff to include UPS solutions in every recent project, says Gary Shurman, president of the Metairie, La.-based solution provider. \n\"We do a lot of accounting software solutions, and we won't install a network without a UPS on every server, workstation, hub and router,\" says Shurman. \"When we get a severe thunderstorm roll through here, many times power will be out from a few minutes to a few hours. You really get some equipment damage from that.\" \nImplementing UPS solutions up front reduces Software & Stuff's maintenance and warranty costs, Shurman says. \"You don't have to [make] service calls or replace equipment because of intermittent failures,\" he says. \nAdds Chris Boaglio, senior channel manager for VARs and computer distribution at MGE UPS Systems, a Costa Mesa, Calif.-based UPS vendor: \"The power issue will be on the minds of solution providers and customers for the next six months to a year. In some instances, a UPS is considered a necessary peripheral. Most customers need backup that is fail-safe, but the pain level is not there to spend money.\" \nWhile customers aren't clamoring for power protection now as they were when the California outages were at the top of the news, there's still money to be made, says Joe Wolf, president of CompuSystems, a Washington, Mo.-based solution provider. \n\"We have seen a lot of thunderstorms in our area, and we've replaced more than 200 modems in the last three weeks,\" Wolf says. \"But we still have to keep up the fight. It's an ongoing thing. You need to remind [the customers] every single time.\" \nCompuSystems doesn't include UPS solutions when bidding projects, he says, but it reminds customers, before any contracts are signed, how important power protection can be for their business systems. \nMeanwhile, UPS vendors are using Web seminars and other training methods to ensure that solution providers can deliver an effective message about UPSes to end users. \n\"We're working hard to make sure solution providers are armed with tools to help their customers, whether they're dealing with an existing power-protection solution or the end user doesn't have anything at all,\" says John Donovan, director of reseller strategy at American Power Conversion, West Kingston, R.I. \nBusinesses in the United States lose about $50 billion annually because of power outages, according to a recent report issued by the Electrical Power Research Institute. Such statistics can be used to sell UPS solutions, say solution providers. \n\"Even in a small business, the first time you have an outage, you could put 50 employees out of business for a day. That could cost you up to $20,000 plus lost sales. Compare that [loss] to the [cost of] an inexpensive battery,\" says Software & Stuff's Shurman. \nBut end users are growing accustomed to having UPSes installed in new networks, he says. \n\"It's usually pretty painless with a new sale. For existing customers [that don't have UPSes], we go in with power-measuring equipment and prove to them what's happening with their power,\" says Shurman. \"When you show them what the spikes and drops look like for a 24-hour period, they get the picture. \n\"But without that, UPSes can be a hard sell,\" he says. \"The customer would call an electrician, who would use a meter reader and say, 'you've got 120 volts, so you're fine.' \" \nThe global UPS market is expected to generate $6.4 billion in sales this year and will see a compounded annual growth rate of 8.3 percent between 2000 and 2007, says Farah Saeed, an industry analyst with Frost and Sullivan. \n\"In 1999 and 2000 we saw double-digit growth, but the sluggish economy and pricing pressure are factors in the market now,\" Saeed says. \"It's a very mature market, and there's a lot of competition with inexpensive products coming from abroad.\" \nThe median price of a 500-volt-ampere desktop UPS has fallen 20 percent in the past year, says Dave Slotten, director of product management at Tripp Lite, a Chicago-based UPS vendor. \n\"For well under $100, you're picking up a fine UPS for desktop protection with serial or USB connectivity,\" Slotten says. \"There's no excuse not to have one. The payback on them is so obvious.\" \nMargins on UPS products have decreased, along with margins on other hardware products, but power-protection equipment brings in supplemental revenue from service opportunities, says e-Systems' Ngo. \nUPS sales growth in the enterprise has been tempered by the slowdown in data center expansion. Fewer new data centers translates into fewer UPSes sold and deployed in that space. \nBut UPS vendors remain bullish on long-term opportunities that may arise from power-related issues. \n\"In California , fundamental fixes aren't in place,\" Slotten says. \"There's still a trend to consume more and more power. Then you've got [the Bush] administration talking about [building more power plants], but that's a decade off.\" \n--- \nSmaller, Lighter, Faster \nIt's been said that good things come in small packages. Well, it seems that folks in the UPS business are warming up to the old adage. \nFor a while, the UPS earned itself a reputation as the PC's ball and chain-a clunky add-on that always seemed to get in the way. But thanks to technology advances, power-protection systems are becoming lighter, more compact and less expensive, say vendor executives. \n\"One thing that's been a hindrance in the UPS market is the size and weight of the products because of transformers and batteries,\" says Chris Boaglio, senior channel manager for VARs and computer distribution at MGE UPS Systems, a Costa Mesa, Calif.-based UPS manufacturer. \"Transformers are extremely heavy components that add shipping costs and size to a product.\" \nBut some newer UPSes weigh up to 30 percent less than their predecessors and don't compromise on reliability, says Boaglio. \nThe combination of market maturation and new technology is appealing to end users, says Henry Ngo, marketing manager at e-Systems Design, Brea, Calif. \"Products are getting better and smaller, and you can do more with less investment,\" he says. \nThe two dominant UPS platforms today are online and line-interactive. Online products-the newer and more expensive of the two-run continuously off a charging battery to provide clean, consistent power. Line-interactive batteries start only if the incoming source is interrupted, say executives. \nWhile line-interactive solutions still dominate the UPS market, the online variety is catching up as its pricing goes down, they say. \n\"It's like getting a Cadillac at a Chevy price,\" says Dave Slotten, director of product management at Chicago-based Tripp Lite. Online UPSes regenerate perfect power for computing equipment, not the spikes and dips that sometimes plague other power-protection systems, he says. \nSpurring demand is the fact that UPS prices have fallen more than 10 percent in the past year, says Gary Shurman, president of Software & Stuff, Metairie, La. \nAlso, the boom in networking and storage solutions has led to the penetration of UPSes beyond desktops and servers, say solution providers. \n\"Network surge protection is an increasing opportunity as wireless components get installed,\" says Joe Wolf, president of CompuSystems, Washington, Mo. \"That's opening up some doors.\" \n\nFERC Hearing Ends On $2B In NW Power Sales Refund Claims\nBy Bryan Lee\n\n09/10/2001 \nDow Jones Energy Service \n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) \nOF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n   (This article was originally published Friday.) \n   \nWASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An expedited Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative hearing on claims for $2 billion in refunds on electricity sales in the Pacific Northwest concluded Thursday after three days of legal wrangling. \nThe proceeding, which FERC spun off from a high-profile controversial case involving California 's power-refund claims, poses a legal and logistical hornet's nest for the commission, according to attorneys involved. \nPower sellers subject to a possible FERC refund order themselves potentially could seek refunds for power they purchased in the region. \nUntold billions of dollars of these so-called \"ripple\" refund claims were held in abeyance by the FERC administrative law judge presiding in the case. But if FERC orders refunds, these power sellers have reserved the right to seek refunds, which in some cases could amount to more than they ultimately owe. \nBut that's a long-term issue. More immediate is the power sellers' constitutional due-process concerns about the expedited proceeding, which allowed limited evidence and cross-examination of witnesses. \nThen there's the problem of defining what is a spot-market sale in what is largely a bilateral contracts market. Various refund claims address not only sales of 24-hours duration, but month-long blocks and, in some cases, longer than a year. \nMeanwhile, municipal utility sellers, technically not subject to FERC regulatory jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act, are challenging the commission's assertion of authority to order them to make refunds. Municipal utilities make up roughly half of the Pacific Northwest market. \nAnd finally, the case has turned into a second bite of the apple for California in its effort to obtain refunds. \nRoughly $1.5 billion of the total claims is being sought by California , with the remainder representing claims from a handful of municipal utilities in the region, according to attorneys involved in the proceeding. \nOf California 's total claim, more than $556 million is sought from Powerex, the U.S. marketing arm of British Columbia Hydro, a provincially owned utility, for sales under contracts with the California Department of Water Resources this year. \n\"I think it's completely outrageous that California 's asking for money,\" said an attorney involved in the case. \"We wouldn't be here if they hadn't screwed this thing up in the first place.\" \nMost parties in the proceeding have asked the judge to throw out California 's claims, another attorney noted. \n \n  Five Municipal Northwest Utilities Seeking Refunds \n   \nOnly five municipal utilities in the Northwest are seeking refunds: Seattle, Wash., $278 million; Tacoma, Wash., $65.4 million; Clark (Wash.) Public Utilities, $64 million; Eugene (Ore.) Water & Electric Board, $39.7 million; the Port of Seattle, Wash., $9.3 million; and Northern Wasco County (Ore.) People's Utility District, $4 million. \n\"The vast majority of those involved in the market are due refunds, but only a minority are seeking refunds,\" said one attorney in the case, among a handful contacted by Dow Jones Newswires who spoke freely on condition they not be identified. \n\"We've made clear if refunds are awarded we are going to come in and demand ours as well,\" said an attorney representing a power marketer. \"When the agency sees that, it will be clear that they have opened a can of worms that they don't want to get into.\" \nWith the expedited hearing concluded, parties in the proceeding must file position briefs by Sept. 14 with the administrative law judge hearing the case, who is scheduled to forward her proposed findings of fact to the commission by Sept. 24. \nJeff Goltz, an attorney with the Washington state attorney general's office, described the power sellers' concerns about due process as misplaced. \nPower sellers were concerned that the fate of billions of dollars hinged on a proceeding lasting a few days, Goltz said. But the proceeding actually was \"a vehicle to decide if FERC will proceed to a larger, well-defined proceeding,\" he said. \n\"I wouldn't expect the FERC to take this and issue a refund decision,\" Goltz said. \nAttorneys representing power providers expressed the hope that FERC won't pursue refunds in the region. \n\"We could get a refund,\" said an attorney representing an investor-owned utility in the region. \n\"But our hope is the whole thing goes away, which it should,\" he said. \"The whole thing's just too complicated. I don't know how the judge is going to make a decision in this case.\" \nThe case represents a \"Pandora's box\" for the commission, said an attorney representing a municipal utility in the region opposed to refunds. \n\"This case has the potential to be far bigger than the California refund case because it involves essentially the entire Western United States,\" the lawyer said. \nIf FERC \"pulls the strings\" and orders refunds, it will trigger \"ripple\" refund claims involving hundreds of thousands of bilateral wholesale power sales contracts throughout the West, he said. \"Where it stops, nobody knows.\" \n\"If you start trying to unravel this market for the period in question (December 2000 through June 2001), it's not going to end for the foreseeable future,\" said another attorney. \n\"Each successive ripple will trigger more ripples.

All Rights Reserved. \nLOS ANGELES (AP) - During the peak of the state's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials previously acknowledged, it was reported Monday. \nDWP officials have insisted for months that the agency sold power for just 15 percent above its costs. In fact, the DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56 percent last year, according to a newly completed audit obtained by the Los Angeles Times under the California Public Records Act. \nThe finding will likely reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes. The audit may also undercut efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to blame rising energy costs on private, out-of-state generating companies. \nThe audit was ordered in May by the DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs. It was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000. \nThe DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the state's deregulation of electricity began to backfire, with supply from private generators contracting and wholesale prices skyrocketing. \nThe DWP - which had opted out of deregulation - cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market, helping to avert even more blackouts. \nAt the same time, though, the DWP and other publicly owned utilities charged some of the highest prices during the crisis, official reports later showed. \nRecords show that during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million, the Times said. The agency says it is still owed $180 million. \nIn an interview with the Times last week, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, insisted that he had issued \"standing orders\" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15 percent. \nFreeman made the same assurance in July in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown. \nHe told the Times he has not seen the audit, but said if profits were higher than 15 percent, then \"I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at (the) DWP.\" \nWiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy during Freeman's tenure, but he said that even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. \n\"We charged just and reasonable rates,\" Wiggs told the Times, adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin. \nBut for consumers'-rights activists, the findings were new ammunition. \n\"Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair,\" said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union, the nonprofit that publishes Consumer Reports. \"This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks, savings and loans and insurance companies - not a public agency.\" \n\nNatural Gas Bills Will Decrease for California Utility Customers\nBruce Spence\n\n09/08/2001 \nKRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Record - Stockton, California \nCopyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) \nPG&E residential customers will see this month's natural gas bills drop on average by nearly a third from a year ago, when supplies were short and market prices were zooming. \nSupplies are up and prices are down now because drillers went at it last winter trying to take advantage of high market prices. After a January price spike, prices have since declined nearly to the level of two winters ago, said Christy Dennis, Pacific Gas & Electric spokeswoman. \nAlthough there was such a shortage of natural gas last winter that there were threats of service cuts, supplies for this winter should be ample, she said. \n\"We are in much better shape this year than we were last year,\" Dennis said. \nThe natural-gas industry reports that falling prices promise to push some drillers out of the market again. \n\"But if you're talking about this winter, it's a sunny picture,\" said \nLaurie Cramer, spokeswoman for the Natural Gas Supply Association in Washington, D.C. \"Production is up even if prices are down.\" \nPerhaps most important, she added: \"We don't expect the kind of volatile market we had last year.\" \nFrom August 1999, gas prices rose from less than $3 per thousand cubic feet to $11 by the beginning of this and have since fallen to under $2.50. \nDennis said that in September 2000, the average PG&E residential natural gas customer, using 30 therms of gas during a 30-day cycle, paid $26.11 for the natural gas portion of the gas bill. \nThis month, that same 30 therms will cost $17.87, a nearly 32 percent drop from a year ago, she said. \nThe big question, of course, is the outlook for the heart of winter. \nThe utility isn't speculating because demand and thus supplies can be unsettled by an unusually cold winter. \nBut the gas market trend points to only a slight increase from now through the heavy cold months as natural-gas consumption rises, Dennis said. \nIn January, residential customers use about 70 therms of gas. In January 2000, the bill for that was about $50. Last January, averaged $122.30, Dennis said. \nElizabeth Field has both a gas stove and water heater in her Stockton home, and, she said, she was delighted to hear that her gas bill should be down from last winter. \n\"My natural gas bill doubled over the winter,\" she said. \"Between gasoline prices for the car and my PG&E bill, it was a big deal.\" \nSam Baygi, owner of El Dorado Florist, 1439 N. El Dorado St., said that higher gas prices didn't really seem to hit him hard over the winter. The important factor at his shop is to keep the flowers cool, anyway. \nAnd at home, his gas costs seemed up maybe slightly, he recalled, but all in all, he didn't feel pounded. \n\"I don't think it was so big of a deal.\" \nDennis said supplies should be sufficient for PG&E's 3.7 million natural gas customers, despite that many of the usual suppliers quit doing business with PG&E because of the utility's bankruptcy proceedings and credit poundinge . \nThe utility's financial woes began last summer when spot-market spikes for electricity produced high power prices that PG&E had to pay to try to keep the power on in California . \nThe national natural-gas association is three weeks away from finishing its tabulation of production numbers and forecasting winter supplies. \nBut Cramer said natural-gas producers still face many of the same challenges they faced last year, such as a shortage of workers and equipment. \nAlso, some of the biggest discovered natural-gas reserves, in the Rocky Mountains region and in the Gulf of Mexico, remain untapped because of government restrictions. \n\"There's still a lot off-limits to producers,\" Cramer said. \nAlso, about two-thirds of drillers are small \"mom-and-pop\" type operations that can be driven out of production by low prices, she said. \n\"It's a capital-intense industry, and they usually don't have a lot of capital.\" \n\n\nScottish Power Sets $300 Million Charge for Excess-Power Costs at U.S. Unit\n\n09/10/2001 \nDow Jones Business News \n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) \nDow Jones Newswires \nLONDON -- Scottish Power PLC faced a new setback Monday after the company said it will take a $300 million charge in the second quarter for additional excess-power costs at its PacifiCorp unit in the U.S. \nThe United Kingdom-based utility said the charge will reduce the contribution of PacifiCorp to Scottish Power's earnings for the year to March 2002 by around nine pence (13.1 U.S. cents or 14.6 European cents) a share, or 25%. \nThe announcement of the charge, which Scottish Power (SPI) said was linked to extreme volatility in U.S. forward electricity markets, knocked the company's shares. In midday trading in London, Scottish Power declined 12% to 424 pence. \nThe news couldn't have come at a worse time for the beleaguered U.K. utility, which was just beginning to recover from the effects of last year's six-month outage at its Utah Hunter power plant. The outage, which forced Scottish Power to buy power on western U.S. wholesale markets overheated by the California energy crisis, contributed to $400 million in excess-power costs the company reported for its latest fiscal year, which ended March 31. \nIn an effort to avoid exposing itself anew to unprecedented price spikes, which were forecast to continue through the end of 2001, Scottish Power overcompensated in its forward contracts, leading to the new $300 million charge, the company said. \n\"All we are doing is making sure PacifiCorp has sufficient power to meet its regulatory obligations,\" Chief Executive Ian Russell said Monday. \"The difficult thing is that when we bought that power to meet regulatory supply obligations, we were buying at a price that is over ten times what it is today.\" \nA combination of lower demand, more capacity, price caps and cooler-than-expected summer weather have led to a collapse in U.S. prices to around $30 per megawatt-hour currently, from an average of more than $200 per megawatt-hour in the first quarter, the company said. \nScottish Power will seek recovery of the excess charges from U.S. regulators in the months to come, Mr. Russell said. The company is also reviewing its risk-management policies. \nThe new charges \"draw a line under the episode that started last winter with this spike in prices,\" Mr. Russell said. \nABN Amro analyst Alistair Buchanan said market was \"shocked\" by the announcement and that investors will want to know why they weren't warned earlier. \nOn the brighter side, Mr. Russell and Chief Financial Officer David Nish noted that the company last week won a $64.4 million revenue increase from regulators in the state of Oregon, most of which is related to increased power costs. \nAlthough the tariff increase was only 60% of the $103 million the company was seeking, Mr. Nish said the company was encouraged by the regulator's agreement to allow PacifiCorp to defer compliance with the new Oregon baseline power cost in tariffs until May 2002. The agreement also allows PacifiCorp to propose a permanent power-cost recovery mechanism, he added. \nThe company is expecting a decision from Utah regulators on a separate $100 million tariff-increase request in the next couple of days. \nThe Oregon rate decision is a positive one for Scottish Power, analysts said, but several said it will be overshadowed by the $300 million charge which is far higher than the $190 million in excess costs some were expecting this year. \n\"The most important thing, is that the time at which they said they will get acceptable rates of interest from this business [PacifiCorp] hasn't changed,\" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, utilities analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. \nCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCalif DWR Hasn't Received Any Invoice From ISO For Power\n\n09/10/2001 \nDow Jones Energy Service \n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) \n(This article was originally published Friday) \n \n   By Mark Golden \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n   \nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources has never received an invoice from the California Independent System Operator for power purchased on behalf of the state's insolvent utilities, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Friday. \nBetween the middle of January, when Gov. Gray Davis ordered the DWR to start paying for ISO power purchases and May 31, the ISO has procured about $3.3 billion in power on behalf of California 's cash-strapped utilities, PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison, according to the ISO. \nNone of that power has been paid for, according to the ISO, as previously reported. The ISO and DWR have been negotiating the procedure for settling the accounts, but sellers to the ISO have been complaining that it shouldn't take eight months for the state agencies to get payments flowing. \n\"Until we get a bill that we can account for, we can't write a blank check and send it out. We haven't even received an improper bill,\" said Hidalgo. \nThe ISO was unable to comment immediately on whether it has sent a bill to the DWR for power purchased on behalf of the utilities. The ISO has said previously that it can't supply all the information the DWR wants without violating its own confidentiality rules. \nThe Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents many of the suppliers to the ISO, said this week the ISO market is on the verge of collapsing. Merchant power companies in California , such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) continue to sell to the ISO, as ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nThe ISO, which has ultimate responsibility for avoiding blackouts, ensures there is exactly the right amount of power on the state's transmission lines to meet demand at all times, which requires constant buying and selling of electricity . \nIn mid-January, after the state's two main utilities ran out of cash, an executive order from Davis - backed by state law passed in February - authorized the DWR to pay for any purchases the ISO needed to make for the utilities. \n\"There is no bill. I don't know as a government agency how the process of payment for a significant amount of money - over $1 billion - would be in anybody's mind as a possibility,\" Hidalgo said. \nThe DWR, which has paid more than $9 billion for power it has bought from suppliers directly since January, has set aside money to pay for the ISO's last-minute purchases. \nThe ISO considers the entire $3.3 billion unpaid, though DWR operations chief Pete Garris said earlier this week that DWR may have paid a majority of that bill directly to power suppliers. The DWR has set aside about $1.25 billion to pay suppliers once it receives a detailed bill from the ISO that meets DWR requirements. Other procedural problems have prevented the DWR from making payment. The DWR wants to pay suppliers directly, which Garris said the ISO is uncomfortable with. \nThe ISO declined to discuss this direct-payment issue. ISO market rules require that buyers pay the ISO, which, in turn, pays sellers. \nThe FERC has ordered the ISO to stop buying power on behalf on parties that aren't creditworthy, specifically Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison. PG&E has said that it continues to receive bills from the ISO, and has been told the bills are for informational purposes only. \n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com \n\nShocking facts about deregulation\nLinda McQuaig\n\n09/10/2001 \nNational Post \nNational \nPage C14 \n(c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved. \nAmong the many things one might want to do in the privacy of one's own home late at night, checking out electricity prices may not be high on the list. \nYet oddly enough, this appears to be one of the main selling features of the Harris government's plan to deregulate the Ontario electricity market next year. \nOnce electricity is deregulated, the price of a kilowatt of energy will change by the minute, with prices posted on the Internet every hour. Really keen consumers who don't want to wait a whole agonizing hour can have meters installed right in their homes. So, for instance, if the price per kilowatt hour hits rock bottom at 4:36 a.m., these well-equipped folk won't have to wait until the top of the hour to shove the laundry into the washing machine, turn on the dishwasher and get out the vacuum cleaner. \nThis is all part of what deregulation enthusiasts like John Grant, an economist who has been involved in the provincial deregulation plans, see as the \"empowerment\" consumers will enjoy under deregulation. \nWell, I certainly wouldn't want to underestimate the pleasure of being able to select the perfect time to maximize one's electricity consumption -- but will it be enough to compensate for the higher prices that will almost certainly accompany this deregulation? \nWe know deregulation produced dramatically higher electricity prices in Alberta and California . In Alberta, prices rose to five times previous levels last winter; in California , power costs surged at times to levels 5,000% above normal. \nSupporters of deregulation prefer to look at what has happened elsewhere. Michael Trebilcock, a University of Toronto law professor and long-time pusher of electricity deregulation, points to deregulation in Australia and the U.K., where, he says, electricity prices fell by 10% to 15%. \nMaybe I'm missing something here, but it sounds like what we're faced with is a best-case scenario under which deregulation saves us possibly 10% to 15% off our power bills. (Wow.) The worst-case scenario, however, involves us paying amounts that are potentially staggering. If we do things as badly as California , we could see increases from time to time in the 5,000% range. Vacuuming could become not only an exclusively late-night pleasure, but a luxury we can only dream of. \nDon't the odds seem to be stacked against us on this one? It seems a bit like agreeing to a coin toss -- Heads, you win 10 cents; tails, you lose $50. But let's go for it! \nAnd in case it sounds like I'm distorting things, it should be noted that this is essentially the picture presented by advocates of deregulation. Trebilcock, for instance, doesn't argue that the savings will be big, only that there may be some savings, as there were in Australia and the U.K. \nIn a recent presentation to the Institute for Policy Analysis in Toronto, Trebilcock acknowledged that the \"adverse experiences\" in jurisdictions like California and Alberta made him \"nervous.\" But, in any event, he wasn't sure it was possible, at this stage in Ontario, to put the genie back in the bottle. How's that for a ringing endorsement from one of deregulation's leading proponents? \nMeanwhile, Myron Gordon, a professor of finance at U of T's Rotman School of Management, argues that the Ontario deregulation will be a \"complete disaster,\" not just for consumers but for the Canadian business community. Gordon insists that surging, unpredictable electricity costs will strip Ontario industries of the competitive advantage they've long enjoyed over their counterparts in neighbouring U.S. states. \nGordon scoffs at the notion that there might be price savings. He notes that, once our electricity is deregulated, it will be subject to the rules of NAFTA. Under NAFTA, we can't withhold energy supplies from U.S. customers, or charge them more than we charge ourselves, so electricity shortages in the United States will push our prices here up to U.S. levels. Better do the vacuuming now. \nWhat makes all this infuriating is that Gordon insists that if we just left things as they are -- with a regulated price in a regulated market -- we could keep our prices below the United States, while covering the full cost of generating the electricity we need, and having some supply left over for profitable export. This is pretty much what B.C. has opted to do. \nIt's not surprising, then, that deregulation aficionados are pushing things other than price savings to get the public excited about this bold venture into the new economy. \nJohn Grant likes to emphasize the huge array of consumer choice that lies ahead. Consumers will be able to choose electricity packages that also include long distance telephone and Internet service; they'll be free to choose between \"Standard Supply\" (where the wholesale price of energy will be passed through to them and they may be entitled to a rebate) or instead opt for whatever deal is offered by their distributor. Or they can choose to deal directly with a retailer who offers fixed prices for a year or more, or another who will install a meter in their home so they can track minute-by-minute price fluctuations. \nNot that life will be problem-free in this consumer nirvana. Grant poses the question: \"If consumers sign up to a retailer's fixed price offer and sign away their right to [a possible] rebate, do they know what they have given up?\" Clearly, lots to talk about around the water cooler or over a cold beer after work. \nIt's hard to imagine what people did late at night before there was a new economy\n\nCommentary Bailout Scheme for Edison Fails Tests Again ...\nWILLIAM BRADLEY\n\n09/10/2001 \nLos Angeles Times \nHome Edition \nPage B-11 \nCopyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company \nAt a late night session Thursday, the California Assembly emulated its deregulation forebears, narrowly adopting another complex, half-understood energy bill from the back rooms. \nThere are many problems with the proposed state bailout of Southern California Edison. Here are the most fundamental: \n* The bailout is much bigger than advertised . Backers, including Gov. Gray Davis, parent company Edison International and some Los Angeles progressives, advertise it as a $2.9-billion deal. In reality, when interest on bonds and other benefits are added in, it will cost closer to twice as much. \n* Tangible assets for the public, once central to the deal, have been stripped from it. The Edison rescue was to center on the state's acquisition of the utility's transmission lines. Ownership of the grid would have given the state leverage it has lacked over power generators, and state ownership would make critically needed upgrades cheaper to finance. This fell away when Pacific Gas & Electric declared bankruptcy this spring, taking a huge chunk of the private grid off the market. While some Sierra lands receive protection from development, the state gains no ownership. Coastal and desert lands are unprotected. \n* Edison already has received three state bailouts. First it, along with the other big private utilities, received billions in a bailout of \"stranded assets,\" most notably nuclear, that was part of the 1996 deregulation deal. It received billions more as part of the above-market consumer rates locked in by the deregulation deal--until companies that bought the power plants Edison cleverly sold them turned the screws last year. These funds enabled Edison International to run a high-flying global merchant power operation. Then Edison received a third bailout earlier this year, when the state spent $1 billion to replace power lost from the troubled San Onofre nuclear plant. \nEdison is hypocritical in coming to the Capitol with its hand out yet again, especially given its central role in pushing through the deregulation scheme from which it now wants to be rescued. Edison International CEO John E. Bryson trades on his past progressive status as a Natural Resources Defense Council co-founder to distract from reality. When Gov. Pete Wilson signed deregulation into law, Bryson called it \"a great day for us.\" \nYet even with the billions Edison has gotten in previous bailouts, a state rescue effort might be justified were the process not so remarkably compromised. Davis sent Michael R. Peevey, a former Southern California Edison president, to represent the state in negotiations with Edison. Not surprisingly, this led to a generous deal for the company, with the state negotiating for things that the state Public Utilities Commission could have required the company to do anyway. Although that deal died, what is now on the table is fatally flawed by the sweetheart deal template from which it sprang. \nSo eager is Davis to bail out Edison that he would allow big business customers to cut their own private power contracts. This could leave the rest of us holding the bag on his hugely expensive long-term power contracts. \nPerhaps worst of all is the tremendous distraction caused by the months of maneuvering to save Edison from its own miscalculations. As we emerge from panic mode, California has serious problems, including a new crazy-quilt of state energy agencies and long-term power contracts that perpetrate a \"green\" blackout, ignoring renewable energy in favor of a new generation of fossil fuel plants. \nThe situation would have been far more rational and efficient had everyone involved not had to waste inordinate amounts of time dealing with the special pleadings of one privileged corporation. \nEnough.\n\nPG&E DISPUTES COST SHIFT \nTHE AGENCY THAT BUYS STATE UTILITIES' ELECTRICITY HAD ASKED REGULATORS TO APPROVE UNIFORM RATES, BUT PLAN IS UNDER REVIEW\nMIKE TAUGHER \nTIMES STAFF WRITER\n\n09/06/2001 \nContra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, CA) \nFinal \nPage a01 \n(c) Copyright 2001, Contra Costa Times. All Rights Reserved. \nSAN FRANCISCO -- A plan to shift $600 million in electricity costs from Southern California to Pacific Gas & Electric Co. came under heavy fire Wednesday when the San Francisco-based utility launched a media campaign to oppose the plan and Northern California lawmakers blasted it as potentially illegal. \nEven if it costs the state more to buy power in the north, it is doubtful that the differences are enough to justify such a large transfer of costs, according to a letter signed by 30 of the 31 Northern California members of the Assembly. \nAt issue is how the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for financially strapped utilities since January, will be repaid for its electricity purchases this year and next. The agency had asked state regulators to approve a uniform price tag of 11.4 cents for each kilowatt-hour it sells to utility customers. \nBut under the plan now being considered by the Public Utilities Commission, PG&E customers would pay 14 cents per kilowatt-hour through next May, while customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric would pay 10 cents and 9 cents, respectively. \n\"This appears to be an unsubstantiated and illegal cost shift to Northern California customers,\" lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to PUC President Loretta Lynch. \nThe PUC had planned to consider the issue today, but it is among several items that have been delayed for as long as two weeks as the commission struggles to issue regulations needed to allow the state to borrow more than $12 billion on the bond market. \nLynch said linking the price of electricity to the actual cost to the state of providing it instead of spreading out the toll that the electricity crisis has exacted on California equally is consistent with the way the commission has traditionally imposed rates. \n\"That is the methodology the commission has used for decades,\" Lynch said. \"It would be discriminatory to have Edison customers and SDG&E customers subsidize PG&E customers.\" \nStill, Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla, D-Pittsburg, said that unless the plan is modified, Northern California lawmakers might block legislation designed to keep SoCal Edison out of bankruptcy. That legislation, which could come to the Assembly floor as early as today, has been a key part of Gov. Gray Davis' strategy to navigate California out of the electricity crisis. \n\"I don't know how anyone in the north is going to be able to justify voting for a bailout for Edison that shifts any of these costs onto PG&E customers, directly or indirectly,\" Canciamilla said. \nAccording to Canciamilla, relieving SoCal Edison of hundreds of millions of costs for state-purchased power could help the Southern California utility finance $1 billion in debts to generators, which in turn would help make the bailout plan work. \n\"I don't think the real motivation is retribution (against PG&E for defying Davis by declaring voluntary bankruptcy in April) as much as it is trying to figure out a way to assist in making a bailout (of SoCal Edison) work,\" Canciamilla said. \nMeanwhile, PG&E took out radio spots and ads in three newspapers Wednesday, urging customers to complain to the PUC about the plan. \n\"The commission substantially changed the formula, and as a result our customers would be forced to pay more,\" said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. \nThat claim is mostly true, but potentially misleading. PG&E's customers would pay more for the electricity purchased by the state, but whether that would lead to a higher overall electricity bill is not clear. \nThat is because the PUC has yet to determine how much PG&E should earn on electricity generated at the plants it still owns. If PG&E is allowed to earn relatively little, then no rate increase would be needed. \nBut if the sum of the rate collected by DWR and the rate collected by PG&E exceeds what customers are paying now, then another rate hike could occur. \nThe PUC's Lynch, who assured reporters this spring that no rate hikes would be needed after the commission approved increases totaling 4 cents per kilowatt-hour this year, was noncommittal Wednesday about the possibility of a further increase for PG&E customers. \nPaul Clanon, head of the PUC's energy division, said the likelihood of a rate increase for PG&E customers would become clearer near the end of the month, when drafts begin circulating to address the rate that PG&E may collect. \nPUC officials did say, however, that no rate hike would hit customers of Southern California utilities. \nState officials say it costs far more to provide power in the north because the state has to buy more electricity to serve Northern California and there is comparatively less electricity available in the northern part of state and in the Pacific Northwest. \nThat pinch between supply and demand is exacerbated by transmission constraints that make it more difficult to bring electricity up from Southern California, according to DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. \nThe state supplies about 40 percent of the electricity used by PG&E customers, with the rest being generated at PG&E plants or under existing contracts, especially with alternative energy generators. \n\nCALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SEEKS PROBE OF POWER CUTBACK\nBloomberg News\n\n09/01/2001 \nThe Arizona Republic \nFinal Chaser \nPage D3 \nCopyright (c) 2001, The Arizona Republic \n-- California Secretary of State Bill Jones plans to ask federal regulators to investigate allegations that officials colluded to reduce output at a power plant to save the state money on energy trading. \nJones plans to seek the Republican nomination to challenge Gov. Gray Davis in next year's gubernatorial campaign. He will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to start an investigation, said Beth Pendexter, a spokeswoman for Jones. The probe would focus on why a state agency may have ordered Edison International's utility to reduce output at a plant in Nevada. \nThe state Department of Water Resources would be a target of the investigation, Pendexter said. The department may have sought to slow production at the Mojave power plant, she said. Because the state buys power at higher prices in long-term contracts, it loses money when it has to sell electricity cheaply during a time of excess supply. \nThe Department of Water Resources has spent almost $9 billion buying electricity for PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison's Southern California Edison, which are insolvent after running up billions in debts under the state's deregulation law. The department has signed about $43 billion in long-term energy contracts. \n\nThe State Davis Upbeat on $2.9-Billion Edison Plan Energy: Governor is optimistic that Senate, Assembly versions can be reconciled and a bill sent to him next week, before session ends.\nMIGUEL BUSTILLO; NANCY RIVERA BROOKS\n\n09/08/2001 \nLos Angeles Times \nHome Edition \nPage B-10 \nCopyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company \nSACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis expressed optimism Friday that a $2.9-billion plan to try to restore Southern California Edison to financial health will reach his desk before next Friday, when legislators adjourn for the year. \nA day after the state Assembly narrowly approved the measure, the Democratic governor said that although it still needs to be reconciled with a slightly different version approved earlier by the Senate, he is confident the bill will clear the Legislature. \n\"I'm hopeful that we get the [rescue plan] ratified by a week from today, the last day of the session,\" Davis said Friday during a breakfast meeting in Sacramento. \"I think that's entirely doable now, since it's passed both houses, albeit in different forms. Our goal will be to get that done before the Legislature recesses.\" \nDavis' optimism contrasted with angry words from consumer activists, who oppose the bill as a bailout of Edison. \n\"Is this the best deal the Assembly can get from a company that claims to be desperately in need of help?\" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. \"It reads as if the same scoundrels that led the Legislature into deregulation--the utilities and the large commercial customers--are still running the show.\" \nEdison executives offered a subdued response during a conference call with investors Friday, maintaining that the road to restoring the company's finances in the Capitol remains long. \n\"This is another step in the trail,\" said Theodore Craver Jr., chief financial officer of Edison International, parent company of the Rosemead-based utility. \"We obviously have a long way to go yet in terms of additional steps at the Senate, but it's good to see some momentum there.\" \nThe bill, SB 78xx, by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), is a slimmed-down version of a rescue deal Davis reached with the debt-strapped utility this spring to keep it out of bankruptcy. \nIt has cleared both houses, but still needs final approval in the Senate, where Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) plans to take several days to review the changes made in the Assembly to determine whether the measure is viable. \nIn many ways, the two versions are alike. Both would allow the utility to float bonds that would be used to repay about three-fourths of the $3.9-billion debt Edison incurred purchasing electricity during the early days of the energy crisis. Edison bought the power on the volatile open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a state-imposed rate freeze. \nEdison would be permitted to use the money to pay back most of its creditors--banks and small alternative energy producers. Both bills would bar Edison from using the money to repay large energy companies, which Democratic legislators accuse of gouging the state during the crisis. The utility would be on its own to pay or negotiate the $1 billion it owes those companies. \nUnder the Assembly version, the bonds would be paid off by about 180,000 of Edison's large- and mid-sized business customers, those that use 20 kilowatts and up. Under the Senate version, a smaller number of the largest businesses would foot the tab. Under both bills, residential customers and most small businesses would be spared. \nSupporters of the bill say that neither version would require an additional increase in electricity bills. Opponents question that assertion. \nBecause the company would still have sizable debts even if the bill passes, Edison representatives say they cannot guarantee they will not wind up in bankruptcy. Robert Foster, Edison International's executive vice president of external affairs, told investors Friday that the bill \"still leaves Southern California Edison at risk.\" \n\"Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the progress made by the Assembly toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore Southern California Edison to credit-worthiness,\" Foster said. \nIn both plans, Edison would also agree not to pursue a series of lawsuits and legal claims against the state. Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, has filed suit against the state, charging that the rate freeze illegally prohibited the company from recovering its costs of providing power to customers. \nBoth bills also would give the state conservation rights to 20,000 acres of mostly wilderness land near Edison's hydroelectric power reservoirs. \nThe original rescue deal from last spring hinged on the state purchasing Edison's power grid. Some legislators and consumer activists said the grid could be upgraded with public financing to improve the distribution of power and prevent the likelihood of blackouts. But legislators have questioned the value of owning a third of the state's power lines--the share controlled by Edison--and the bills minimize the grid acquisition. \nUnder the Senate plan, the state would have an option to purchase the lines at $1.2 billion or book value, less than half what Davis initially proposed. The Assembly plan would give the state a similar option, requiring further action by the Legislature before it could be exercised. The Assembly bill would pay the utility twice book value or fair market price, whichever was lower. \nThe Assembly and Senate versions contain provisions that would allow businesses to pursue \"direct access\" contracts to buy electricity from energy companies instead of from the utility. Participating businesses would have to pay an exit fee of sorts to cover their share of the utility's debt bonds. \n\nPower Politics in the Senate\n\n09/10/2001 \nThe New York Times \nPage 28, Column 1 \nc. 2001 New York Times Company \nThis has not been a good year for clear thinking about energy. First came the Cheney-Bush ''national energy strategy,'' which presupposed that the country was in the grips of a terrible energy shortage and that the only sure way to address it was to drill aggressively for more oil and gas, remove various regulatory impediments to the burning of coal and build 1,300 new power plants. The House of Representatives swallowed the Cheney-Bush scenario whole and produced an alarmingly unbalanced energy bill with $33 billion in tax breaks -- $27 billion for traditional energy producers, only $6 billion for conservation. \nThe Senate must now set things right, presumably at lower cost; even the Bush administration was appalled by the House's price tag. What this country wants is an energy policy that encourages oil and gas exploration without corrupting the environment, finds more efficient ways to use the energy we have and begins planning for the day when the fossil fuels we take for granted are less abundant at home or abroad. This will not be an easy task; energy politics gets nasty (and local) in a hurry. In the House, for example, many normally reliable friends of the environment voted in favor of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the oil companies and against increasing fuel economy standards because they were terrified of retaliation from organized labor if they did otherwise. \nThis is a rare chance for the Senate to exercise statesmanship while reaping political rewards as well. Polls show that the two issues on which President Bush is most vulnerable are energy and the environment. The Senate cannot lose if it produces a plan more balanced and enlightened than his. It will be up to Jeff Bingaman, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to devise such a plan. Then Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, must sell it to his colleagues. \nThere are three areas where the House bill requires complete overhaul. \nImproving Efficiency: The House bill dedicates $5.9 billion in various subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable energy, versus about $27 billion for the coal, oil and gas industries. It creates modest tax credits for people who buy hybrid cars, for builders of more energy-efficient homes and for manufacturers of some energy-saving appliances. But it does nothing to improve the efficiency of one of the biggest energy users of all, air-conditioners, and it is here that the Senate could usefully resurrect the tough standards imposed by the Clinton administration that President Bush is trying to roll back. \nThe most important and courageous step, however, and one the House refused to take, would be to close the so-called S.U.V. loophole, under which large vehicles like sport utility vehicles and minivans are classified as light trucks and thus escape the 27.5-mile-per-gallon standard required of ordinary cars. Closing that loophole, which Detroit is perfectly capable of doing, would result in oil savings of one million barrels a day by 2015, more than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could be expected to yield in the same time frame. \nIncreasing Supply: At the heart of the House bill is a proposal to open up the refuge's coastal plain to oil exploration. That would yield only six months' to a year's worth of oil, even at favorable prices, while disrupting an ecological treasure. Industry assertions that drilling would create 750,000 new jobs have been widely discredited. \nThere are other steps the committee can take to increase supply. One is to see whether there is an environmentally safe way of tapping and transporting the vast supplies of natural gas at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, where the oil industry is already firmly ensconced. Such a scheme would be expensive, and in some quarters controversial, but it makes a lot more sense than invading the refuge, the national forests, the Rocky Mountain Front and other sensitive areas on which the oil industry and the Cheney task force have cast a covetous eye. \nImproving Reliability: The House was so fixated on subsidizing traditional energy producers, including the coal-fired utilities, that it paid no attention to the way electricity is regulated and transported. That was a huge oversight that Mr. Bingaman says he intends to remedy. As the now-receding California crisis demonstrated, electricity deregulation has not gone smoothly. There are transmission problems in the West and Northeast. Power does not move easily from one region to another, and the system is full of disincentives that discourage smaller -- and potentially more efficient -- producers of power from entering the market. \nNone of this will come easy for Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Daschle. They must resist President Bush's seductive and specious argument that opening up new areas for oil and gas drilling and easing environmental regulations will provide an immediate economic boost. And powerful corporate and labor forces are arrayed against them. But the nation would like them to give it their best shot. \n\nA Self-Inflicted Wound Aggravates Angst Over Enron\nBy ALEX BERENSON\n\n09/09/2001 \nThe New York Times \nPage 1, Column 1 \nc. 2001 New York Times Company \nSOMETHING is rotten with the state of Enron. \nOr so Wall Street suspects. On Jan. 1, shares in Enron, the giant energy trading company in Houston, stood at $83.13. On Friday, Enron closed at $31.57, down 9.7 percent for the week and 62 percent for the year. The slide has destroyed more than $38 billion in shareholder value. \nIn part, the company's problems are beyond its control, a result of the collapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a coming glut in electricity. But the deepest wound at Enron is self-inflicted. Heavy insider selling, indecipherable accounting practices and a stream of executive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gap between the company and Wall Street. \n''The stock is trading under a cloud,'' says James S. Chanos, the president of Kynikos Associates, a hedge fund in New York. Mr. Chanos began betting against Enron early this year and says he thinks that the company's shares remain overvalued. \nEnron's problems came to a head on Aug. 14, when it announced that Jeffrey K. Skilling, the chief executive, had quit for personal reasons. \nWith his resignation, Mr. Skilling joined a half-dozen other top Enron managers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities. Still, the news came as a surprise because Mr. Skilling was named to his post only in February. \nUnder the best of circumstances, the unexpected departure of a chief executive rattles Wall Street. But hard-headed investors can usually comfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearly departed pooh-bah has left behind. Executives come and go, but numbers are forever. \nUnfortunately, Enron's books offer investors little succor. The complexity of the company's businesses and the way it reports its results make understanding Enron's financial statements essentially impossible. \nOver the last decade, Enron has transformed itself from a simple natural gas pipeline company into the world's largest trader of electricity and gas. Last year, about three-quarters of the company's cash flow came out of the company's wholesale services division, which includes its trading operations. \nBut Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes. Are they short-term or long-term? Is the company hedged, or does it make ''directional bets'' on the prices of the commodities it trades? \nThe answers are crucial, because they determine how much risk Enron has taken to make its money. Big profits are nice. Big profits that come from big, risky trades are a recipe for big, unexpected write-offs. \nEnron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closely related companies in ''related party'' transactions. The company says that the deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and that they have been approved by its board and outside auditors. \nBut related-party deals can provide a convenient way for public companies to shift losses to private affiliates. And Enron's disclosure about its related-party deals, including billions of dollars in asset swaps with a partnership that until recently was controlled by the company's chief financial officer, is notably sketchy. \nIn the good old days, like last year, companies could get away with the unlikeliest of accounting gimmicks, as long as their revenue and profit numbers looked good. But Wall Street has become more demanding, as Enron is learning to its chagrin. \nMark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, says the company is aware of investors' concerns. ''We've got credibility issues on the street, no question,'' Mr. Palmer says. ''We're looking at a lot of ways to give our investors more information.'' \nSooner would be better than later.",

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. \"I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,\" Johnson said. \"Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.\"   Emmitt Smith , RB D! AL! - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. \"It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,\" Smith said. \"I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.\"   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Jo! ne! s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free A! ge! nt Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 ! The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter w! ha! t the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sund! ay! at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

($5.84)\n- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account \nnumbers below).\n\nWe need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. \n\nTHIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY \nARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS \nSCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC \nand Sierra.\n\n\n\nAlso do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do \nnot want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I \nguarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want \ncompetition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they \nare flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  \n\nIt is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.\nIf you have any questions over the weekend call me.\n\nAccount numbers:\nSPP - PAC: 853724\nSPP-SNOHO: 853703\nSPP-PUGET: 853725\n\n\nGeir",

The SJ 20,000 \nwould still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under \nsomeone's transport agreement--in other words it wouldn't be incremental to \nour 850,000/d of firm transport obligations.  I don't know if this will work \nyet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna.  I'm eager to talk to \nSteve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario \nthat Susan researched  a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe \nthere are problems or solutions yet to be considered.

Drew \ncovered his thoughts of not having an Open Season and building the project At \nRisk.  Once we are ready to put the changes into service we would post the \ncapacity.  At this time Donna has received all of her information is putting \ninto a draft.\n\nAfter our meeting this morning, we discussed the possibility of moving only \nthe 850 MMcf/d on the San Juan lateral and not include the 20 MMcf/d of \nfuel.  If we are to only move the 850 MMcf/d, the changing of horsepower may \nnot be needed (I have a call into Ron Matthews for the answer).  The reason \nwe are asking this question is save capital dollars and speed up the in \nservice date.  Planning has said that any change we make at the Gallup \nstation will not work for the main expansion.  Drew and Maria are looking for \na way to bring the fuel or a portion of the 850 MMcf/d in at another point \n(Drew to explain in more detail).  The reason we are asking these questions \nis that engineering says the project will not be ready for service until the \nthird quarter of 2001.

We here at Enron \nJapan have no particular desire (or resources at the moment) to send out EOL \nrelated correspondence from here.  If, however, EOL decides it is better for \nEOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron \nJapan Corp. (as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter) \nrather than any other Enron entity, then we will have to review and sign the \ncorrespondence (since it will create legal obligations for us) or have \nsomeone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney.  \n\nIf you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp. and for the EOL logo to \nbe on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we (EJ) needed to \nregister the logo as a business / trade name here.  I am not sure whether \nthis has been done.  (Also note that at the moment although the Japanese \nversion of the letterhead refers to \"Enron Japan Corp.\", the English \ntranslation says \"EnronOnLine\".  In any case these should be consistent I \nwould think.\n\nOn the other hand, if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC, or another \nEnron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would \nbe our preference.\n\nI know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their \ncustomers over to EOL.  The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the \nmarket.  The time therefore may come when we prefer to \"personalize\" our EOL \ndealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I don't \nthink that time has quite come yet.   \n\nAs a separate issue, if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on \nits letters to Japanese counterparties, it may have to register a branch and \nthis may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC. This would need to \nconsidered by Susan Musch.\n\nPls let me know what you decide to do and again I am sorry about the \nconfusion.\n \nJane McBride\nSenior Legal Counsel\nEnron Japan Corp.\n\nOtemachi 1st Square Bldg.\nWest 11th Floor\n1-5-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku\nTokyo 100-0004\nJapan\n\nURL:        www.enron.co.jp\n\nTel.:       81-3-5219-4500 (Main)\n            81-3-5219-4553 (Direct)\nFax:        81-3-5219-4510\n\nAssistant (Maggy Yamanishi)\nTel.:       81-3-5219-4554          \nEmail:      Yo.Yamanishi@enron.com\n\n\n\n\tJustin Timothy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n\t2000/11/24 10:30\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Jane McBride@Enron\n\t\t cc: Claudia Clark@ECT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Karen O'Day@Enron, David \nMinns/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jennifer deBoisblanc \nDenny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@Enron\n\t\t Subject: Re: EOL Stationery\n\nJane,\n\nGiven EJC want to take responsibility for sending out EOL correspondence to \nJapanese counterparties, does Joe Hirl have the authority to execute Password \nAgreements on behalf of Enron North America Corp.? \n\nJustin  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Justin Timothy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n24/11/2000 12:26 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nJustin Timothy\n24/11/2000 12:24 PM\nTo: Jane McBride/AP/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Claudia Clark@ECT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, David \nMinns/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jennifer deBoisblanc \nDenny/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@Enron, Karen \nO'Day@Enron, Kirsty Hogarth/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Re: EOL Stationery  \n\nJane,\n\nAny information to do with EOL needs to be printed on EnronOnline letterhead. \nI will arrange for the stationery to be printed and going forward will send \nall completed Password Applications including Getting Started kit with cover \nletter etc to EJC in Tokyo so that you can have them signed and forward them \non to the counterparty concerned.\n\nJustin \n\n\n\nJane McBride@ENRON\n24/11/2000 12:07 PM\nTo: Justin Timothy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Claudia Clark@ECT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, David \nMinns/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jennifer deBoisblanc \nDenny/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@Enron, Karen \nO'Day@Enron, Kirsty Hogarth/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \n\nSubject: Re: EOL Stationery  \n\nI think we would prefer that anything from us is approved and signed by us \nhere.

I suggest that perhaps the best way to do it would \nbe for me to process them at my end then send them (along with the rest of \nthe package) on to you guys so that Joe can sign it and it can then be \nforwarded on to the counterparty.
